war sees at least 324 civilians reportedly killed , as first cases of coronavirus now emerge Tripoli , the capital of Libya , has entered its second year of being under siege , part of the most significant upsurge in violence in the country \u2019 s intermittent civil war since 2012 .\nHundreds of civilians have so far died \u2013 with little effort either domestically or internationally to bring the fighting to an end .\nWhile most of the world is currently seeking refuge from the COVID-19 virus in their homes , many Libyans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma : stay in their houses and possibly fall victim to indiscriminate shelling \u2013 or leave their homes , and risk getting infected in the ongoing pandemic .\nAs crude as it may sound , the worldwide corona crisis had initially raised hopes among Libyans that the Libyan National Army ( LNA ) and the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) might agree to a humanitarian ceasefire .\nAfter years of destruction and mismanagement , the country \u2019 s health system is likely incapable of handling both a pandemic and civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockade in Libya coupled with a global collapse in oil prices is also likely to lead to a severe financial crisis .\n\u201c My most recent visit to Tripoli was in early December and it was clear at that point that the population was suffering greatly from the war , with hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes , the only operating airport in the city repeatedly shut down as a result of attacks , and concerns that the fighting would soon enter the city centre , \u201d says Mary Fitzgerald , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Now four months on \u2013 following some of the bloodiest weeks of the war , a damaging oil blockade , and the spectre of the Coronavirus pandemic \u2013 Tripoli residents I speak to are even more fearful of the future .\nThe fact that the war continues with no end in sight shows where the belligerents \u2019 priorities lie.\n\u201d The impact of COVID-19 on this precarious nation has been further amplified by the recent death from the virus of former Libyan Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril .\nOCHA has so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libya , with over 300 people so far in quarantine .\nOver half of all civilian harm in Libya since end of civil war occurred in the last year Libya \u2019 s population has indeed been suffering greatly from the war .\nAccording to Airwars data , between 324 and 458 civilians have been killed nationally by 2,034 air and artillery strikes since April 4th 2019 , and another 576 to 850 injured .\nThis means that 52 % of civilians killed since the end of the civil war in 2011 have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nForeign meddling has exacerbated the impact on the civilian population .\nThe LNA receives support from the United Arab Emirates , Russia , Jordan and Egypt .\nThe GNA , on the other hand , is publicly backed by Turkey and Qatar .\n\u201c The international backers have played a crucial role .\nThe offensive of April 4th , 2019 , was immediately met with tremendous resistance , and eastern Libyan fighters did not want to risk their lives for Haftar 600 miles away from home , \u201d explains Jalel Harchaoui , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hague .\n\u201c The reason the offensive managed to continue is because the UAE intervened militarily .\nEager to offset the LNA \u2019 s weaknesses on the ground , the UAE carried out more than 900 air strikes in the greater Tripoli area last year using Chinese combat drones and , occasionally , French-made fighter jets , \u201d Harchaoui asserts .\nAirwars has recorded local reports of 1,113 LNA or Emirati strikes over the last year , whose air forces have become so intertwined that it \u2019 s often impossible to distinguish who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 209 and 308 civilian deaths , making the LNA and UAE likely responsible for the majority of civilian harm in Libya since April last year .\nBoth air forces were also accused of conducting those individual strikes which resulted in the greatest civilian harm over the last 12 months .\nOn July 3rd 2019 , an airstrike hit a migrant detention centre in Tajoura , most likely conducted by an Emirati fighter jet , according to the BBC .\nThe number of reported deaths has varied between 37 and 80 civilians , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 deaths respectively .\nIn December , a UN Panel of Experts report raised concerns about the thoroughness of the post-strike investigation at Tajoura , and suggested that deaths had been exaggerated .\nConversely , interviews with some eyewitnesses indicate the death toll might actually be higher than 53 .\nThe second biggest reported event was an airstrike on Murzuq on August 4th 2019 , allegedly leading to between 42 and 45 civilian deaths , after a town hall meeting was reportedly hit .\nAgain , the LNA or the Emirates were accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploying Bayraktar TB2 drones and military advisers .\nIn December , the two boosted their military cooperation by formalising a deal .\nAccording to Airwars monitoring of local reports , the internationally recognised GNA government and its close ally Turkey conducted 402 air and artillery strikes over the last year , leading to between 55 and 75 civilian deaths .\nDespite an initially slow performance on the battlefield , the LNA was looking at potential victory towards the end of 2019 , when its Chinese-made Wing Loong drones managed to take out several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ruled the skies \u2013 but was interrupted by the Berlin process and a ceasefire deal between Russia and Turkey .\nThe agreement struck on January 18th brought a brief period of relative peace to the Libyan capital .\nMeanwhile , international backers used this period to smuggle even more weapons into the country , despite supposed commitments to respect the ongoing UN arms embargo .\nThe most important introduction was the Turkish Korkut , a state-of-the-art anti-aircraft gun .\nA UN source , who asked not to be named for this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly within 4km of a Korkut you \u2019 re toast.\n\u201d The source added that this strike range can potentially be extended to 11 km , using ATOM munition .\nHowever this is reportedly harder to deliver according to the source , making it unclear whether they are currently being used in Libya .\n\u201c The Korkuts are currently protecting Mitiga and Misurata airports and they \u2019 re easily hidden in a bush or something similar , \u201d the source says .\nTurkey has supposedly deployed six of these anti-aircraft guns and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haftar can not win the war .\nIf the LNA wants to win now , they have to do something unusual on the frontline.\n\u201d In addition , Turkey provided T155 howitzers as well as armoured vehicles , the BBC uncovered recently .\nMercenaries from Syria have also added manpower to weakened GNA forces .\nThe UAE seem to have reacted to the beefing up of its opponent \u2019 s forces by flying extra military materiel into Libya , sometimes through convoluted routes via Eritrea .\nWhat these deliveries contain is opaque : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , it is harder to determine what the LNA received , \u201d the UN source explains .\nOne interesting recent addition to the LNA \u2019 s arsenal is the Chinese-made DHI-UAV-D-1000JHV2 UAV counter-drone gun .\nFighters have been spotted with the eye-catching device that takes down drones by jamming their signal on several occasions .\nHowever , who delivered the guns to the LNA is unclear according to the UN source .\nThe weapon and mercenary influx on both sides is part of the reason why Libya \u2019 s hopes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berlin peace process \u2013 have proved disappointing .\nInstead of concentrating on assisting relief efforts for any local coronavirus outbreaks , Libyan forces and their international backers are instead exploiting distractions among the international community to resume fighting .\n\u201c The Berlin process has achieved little more than words on paper .\nViolations of the arms embargo have actually increased since the Berlin declaration , \u201d Mary Fitzgerald says .\n\u201c While it remains to be seen what the EU naval operation Irini achieves \u2013 though many are sceptical given its limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that no one is willing to name and shame the most egregious violators of the arms embargo , let alone sanction them.\n\u201d \u201c I still do not think the LNA will be able to win .\nBut it may enter the downtown area of Tripoli and do tremendous amounts of damage while doing so .\nOne also has to highlight the very possible scenario where the Government of National Accord \u2019 s forces and the Turkish mission succeed in expelling the LAAF [ Libyan Arab Armed Forces ] from Tripolitania altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the siege of Tripoli enters its second year , all Libyans face a bleak potential future \u2013 with worries over an escalating conflict ; the COVID-19 pandemic ; and financial uncertainties resulting from the collapse in oil prices .\nHowever this civil war may end , it will likely have grim consequences for Libya \u2019 s long suffering civilians .", "author": "Oliver

released documents reveal Dutch knew about possible high risk to civilians at Hawijah", "content": "Airwars learns that another Coalition ally had refused to conduct deadly Hawijah strike Newly declassified documents released by the Dutch Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs , and the Netherlands Public Prosecutor \u2019 s Office , have revealed a number of disturbing facts about Dutch airstrikes on Hawijah and Mosul in 2015 which killed dozens of civilians .\nThe previously secret documents show , for example , that the Dutch military official with a potential veto over its strikes \u2013 known as the Red Card Holder \u2013 was aware even before the airstrike on Hawijah in June 2015 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians according to locals , that the expected damage from the strike could in fact be greater than the Collateral Damage Estimate ( CDE ) was indicating .\nAt least one other ally within the US-led Coalition had refused to conduct the Hawijah strike based on the available intelligence , Airwars has recently learned .\nIn December 2019 , Airwars submitted a Freedom of Information ( FOIA ) request to the Dutch Ministry of Defence , requesting publication of the MoD \u2019 s own investigation into the bombing of an ISIS IED factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of June 2nd- 3rd 2015 .\nThe airstrike caused significant secondary explosions , leading to the deaths of at least 70 civilians .\nAfter withholding their role in this deadly event from the Dutch public for nearly five years , the government eventually took public responsibility in November 2019 .\nIn addition , the Dutch Ministry of Defence admitted conducting a controversial airstrike on a family home in Mosul in September 2015 , in which four civilians were killed .\nThe Dutch MoD has now released its own additional investigation into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 30th 2016 .\nThe document \u2013 mostly unredacted \u2013 reveals that the Dutch Red Card Holder , the representative in the Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar with the option of vetoing actions which fell outside Dutch rules of engagement , was aware that the potential damage could be greater than the Collateral Damage Estimation , or CDE , was indicating .\nThe report states that the possibility of secondary explosions was taken into account during the planning phase by analysing previous attacks on similar targets .\nThe report reads : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage could be greater than the CDE indicated , but that this expected collateral damage would not extend beyond the industrial complex and that there would therefore only be material damage at night .\nThis damage was then assessed by the Dutch Red Card Holder ( RCH ) as not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.\n\u201d Airwars recently learned from a senior ( non-Dutch ) military official with knowledge of events that at least one other allied military within the Coalition had refused the Hawijah strike , implying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too high .\nThe time of the attack had been moved \u201c to the night hours ( midnight local time ) to minimise the chance of civil traffic and the presence of citizens \u201d .\nHowever , the same report also states that the execution of the mission caused collateral damage to more than 400 buildings in the area \u2013 and that the secondary explosions that the Dutch airstrike triggered were not expected in either the targeting process , or the actual implementation of the strike .\nAn internal Ministry of Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 , a Coalition calculation \u201c shows that there was probably more than 18,060 kilos of explosives stored , making this the largest ISIS IED factory ever.\n\u201d The only time the released investigation mentions civilian casualties is in its final sentence , which states that \u201c there is a likely chance that the airstrike led to civilian casualties , but this can not be additionally proven \u201d .\nThis was despite the fact that just days after the incident , respected media including Reuters were already reporting 70 civilian deaths .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in confidential contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross about civilian casualties in the weeks following the airstrike .\nAt the time , ICRC is said to have estimated the number of civilian fatalities in Hawijah to be as high as 170 .\nWhile the Dutch Ministry of Defence has continuously insisted that victims of Dutch airstrikes should turn to the Iraqi authorities for compensation , a 2014 internal document describing the procedure for minimising and reporting civilian casualties states that the Netherlands itself should assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation , as there were no standard procedure .\nThe document notes that \u201c in the case of CIVCAS [ civilian casualties ] by NLD , compensation schemes will be established .\nThere is no treaty with Iraq that includes possible claims for damages , nor is there any expectation that a treaty will come.\n\u201d Despite this , until now there has been no known effort by the Dutch Ministry of Defence to contact civilian survivors of Dutch airstrikes .\nOn March 6th , a survivor of the Mosul strike which killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , Mr. Basim Razzo , filed a lawsuit against the Dutch government for two million US dollars .\nIn response to additional FOIA requests by Dutch news organisations NOS and NRC , the Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs have released additional internal documents and emails related to the Hawijah incident .\nThese clearly indicate a lack of urgency or apparent concern among officials , despite the known high civilian death toll .\nOn June 4th for example , two days after the Hawijah incident , a Dutch official on secondment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of footage of the strike itself has shown that nothing unusual has taken place , apart from the secondary explosions.\n\u201d That \u201c nothing unusual had taken place \u201d claim is far removed from the accounts eyewitnesses gave of the incident , some of whom compared the event to the city being \u201c hit by a nuclear bomb \u201d .\nIn another email , a Dutch official based at CENTCOM writes : \u201c A perfect target and a perfect hit , that \u2019 s what people are talking about here.\n\u201d On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the Ministry of Defence reads : \u201c Yes , no particularities .\nAll went well on our side .\nDo not expect any attention from the Public Prosecutor \u2019 s Office.\n\u201d While the Ministry was clearly aware of media reports of more than 70 civilian deaths \u2013 they shared , for example a Daily Star article , now offline , mentioning 74 civilian deaths \u2013 internally on June 5th , none of the released emails express urgent concern about civilian harm .\nThe Hawijah case did eventually receive attention from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OM ) , in order to assess whether international humanitarian law had been complied with .\nThe OM has also now released emails and internal documents related to its investigations into the Hawijah and Mosul airstrikes , following FOIA requests by both NRC and NOS .\nHowever , the actual investigations remain classified .\nEven so , Minister of Defence Ank Bijleveld has continuously referred to the OM Hawijah investigation during parliamentary debates .\nBijleveld answered critical questions by MPs on her Ministry \u2019 s lack of transparency during a parliamentary debate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by stating that \u201c the OM has concluded that [ the bombing of Hawijah ] was done lawfully \u201d and that she trusted the OM to be a legitimate and independent institution .\nThe released though heavily redacted documentation indicates , however , that the OM was not investigating the lawfulness of the Hawijah action , as there was no suspicion of punishable criminal behaviour , but was instead conducting a fact-finding mission \u2013 intended to gather information about possible civilian casualties .\nBased on written responses from OM , NOS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than nine months after the incident itself , since it was only in March 2016 that the OM was informed by the Ministry of Defence about possible civilian casualties .\nNRC and NOS also reported that the two pilots involved in the airstrike were only interviewed fifteen months after the incident .\nThis is striking , because the Dutch Public Prosecutor \u2019 s Office was previously rebuked by the European Court of Human Rights in 2014 due to serious deficit in the Jaloud case , in which a civilian was shot dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 .\nThe ECHR criticised the OM for waiting six hours to interview the involved soldier , giving the soldier the time to \u201c construct his own version of the truth \u201d .\nIn the case of Hawijah , it took fifteen months before involved military personnel were interviewed .\nIn addition to the OM investigation into Hawijah being very late , its scope was also limited .\nNRC reports that the OM was dependent solely upon information from Dutch military personnel .\nThe US military also declined to cooperate , because this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation into criminal acts , the declassified emails show .\nThe OM additionally published a previously secret MoD document providing guidance for Dutch participation in the fight against ISIS , which indicates that guidelines were likely breached in the case of Hawijah .\nOne states that \u201c attacks on targets in the vicinity of densely populated areas should be avoided as much as possible , \u201d while another notes that \u201c all reasonable precautions should be taken to avoid wounding or killing civilians or causing damage to civilian objects.\n\u201d It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MoD \u2019 s own released records .\nThe newly declassified documents also reveal new information about a Dutch airstrike on Mosul in 2015 , in which Mr. Basim Razzo lost his wife , daughter , brother and nephew .\nThe pilot responsible for executing that attack recently revealed to Dutch journalists that months after the airstrike , it became clear that what they thought was an ISIS headquarters , was , in fact , a family home .\nThe MoD \u2019 s own investigation , finalised on June 30th , 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available information , there is a chance that the two villas were not a military target and that , while carrying out the mission aimed at ISIS headquarters on 20 September 2015 , possible civilian casualties have fallen , but this can not be substantiated.\n\u201d The report added that \u201c the two villas may have been incorrectly identified by the CAOC as a legitimate military objective .\nThis is the subject of research by the CAOC , in which the Netherlands is not involved.\n\u201d The CENTCOM CIVCAS allegation closure report \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azmat Khan and Anand Gopal for their New York Times investigation The Uncounted , states that the intelligence for the mission was based on \u201c only 1h 35 mins of FMV [ full motion video ] \u2026 collected over three different days \u201d .\nThe erroneous conclusion that the house was an ISIS headquarters was based on the fact that there were no women and children seen around the property in the 95 minutes of footage , and that a person was observed opening the drive gate for cars .\nMr. Razzo has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daughter did not come outside because ISIS forced them to cover themselves and because it was over 40 degrees Celsius during the day at the time , and that both he or his brother would open the gates for visiting cars .\nInstead of being informed by their own MoD of civilian casualties in the airstrike , the OM only started their own investigation into the Mosul case after Mr. Razzo \u2019 s relative , Professor Zareena Grewal , published an opinion piece about the case in the New York Times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additionally reveal that twice , requests from the Dutch Public Prosecutor \u2019 s Office for interviews with key witnesses in the Mosul case ( presumably military officials ) were denied by other nations .\nOne response simply stated that \u201c such interview can not be arranged \u201d .\nAnother email insisted that the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between their respective two countries only allowed for assistance when a criminal investigation was being prepared or was expected , and not in the case of a fact-finding mission .\nOn March 6th 2020 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for two million US dollar .\nIn an accompanying letter , his lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld \u2013 who is also preparing a legal case in name of Hawijah victims \u2013 writes to the Ministry of Defence that \u201c given the very limited and conflicting intelligence , the Netherlands should have declined to execute the strike.\n\u201d The MoD was given three weeks to respond to the claim

denying dozens of civilian deaths from their own actions - even where the US-led Coalition finds such cases to be credible .\nA major international investigation has found compelling evidence that several of the US \u2019 s key European allies in the war against so-called Islamic State routinely deny civilian harm from their own actions \u2013 even where specialist US military personnel within the international Coalition have assessed such cases to be credible .\nThree European countries are implicated \u2013 the United Kingdom , France and Belgium \u2013 a lengthy investigation by the BBC , Lib\u00e9ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found .\nBBC News : US military says strikes may have killed civilians A total of eleven specific civilian harm events have so far been identified \u2013 involving the officially confirmed deaths of at least 40 Iraqi and Syrian civilians during 2017 and 2018 .\nNo European ally will admit to the fatalities .\n\u201c Cases like this expose a fundamental gap in accountability created by multinational coalitions , \u201d notes Dan Mahanty of the US advocacy organisation CIVIC .\n\u201c If warring parties simply collude to hide their actions , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lost loved ones or had their livelihoods destroyed , it means losing any hope of remedy , or even basic acknowledgement of their loss .\nIt \u2019 s a pretty significant affront to their dignity.\n\u201d The problem incidents came to light after the US Defense Department was legally required to report to Congress in May 2019 , on all recent confirmed civilian deaths from US military actions .\nThat Pentagon report declared 170 incidents for Iraq and Syria during 2017 ; and a further 13 events during 2018 .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US civilian harm events against those cases the anti-ISIS Coalition had officially conceded during the same period , it identified 14 further incidents which had been omitted .\nSeveral senior US defense officials independently confirmed to Airwars that all credible non-US civilian harm events had been explicitly excluded from the list given by DoD to Congress .\nThree of these \u2018 missing \u2019 events were previously confirmed Australian civilian harm cases .\nThat left eleven civilian harm incidents which had not publicly been admitted by any US ally \u2013 for example the deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Hayat , the wife of Mustafa al-Saguri , who died alongside her young daughter and a third unknown civilian at al Hammam in Raqqa province .\nThe US-led Coalition had admitted those deaths in April 2019 , noting that \u201c Regrettably , the strike on an associated target building unintentionally resulted in the deaths of three civilians.\n\u201d But which US ally was responsible ?\nDuring 2017 and 2018 , five partners were still active alongside the US in the war against ISIS : the UK , France , the Netherlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammam incident not included in the Pentagon \u2019 s report of US-caused civilian harm events to Congress , Airwars then crossmatched this and ten other unclaimed incidents , against published strike reports by the US \u2019 s allies for the dates in question .\nIn June 2019 , Airwars wrote to each nation \u2019 s military , requesting confirmation of whether its forces had been responsible or not for specific confirmed civilian harm events .\nAustralia quickly responded that it had not conducted either of the incidents it had potentially been flagged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not conduct either of the strikes on 9 January 2017 and 15 May 2017.\n\u201d Nine months later , the Dutch ministry of defence finally confirmed that it was not responsible for those deadly strikes it had in theory been linked to .\nWith indirect confirmation that the eleven officially confirmed civilian harm events had been the responsibility of three European militaries , Airwars then approached major news organisations with which it had engaged previously on civilian harm issues .\nThe BBC , Lib\u00e9ration , RTL Netherlands and De Morgen each then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreed joint embargo .\nThe most comprehensive admission during the investigation came from the UK \u2019 s Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which is among the more transparent members of the US-led Coalition .\nOf the six potential UK events flagged to it by Airwars , the MoD confirmed by letter that it had been responsible for three of the strikes which the Coalition assessed had killed at least 15 civilians .\nHowever , the UK then refuted the US-led Coalition \u2019 s findings , insisting that no civilians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place at Mosul , Iraq on January 9th 2017 , and had already sparked a BBC investigation after a military whistleblower within the Coalition had reported civilian deaths from an RAF strike .\nThe Ministry of Defence had over-ruled that view , determining that no civilians had been harmed .\nFollowing the BBC \u2019 s investigation , US military personnel at the Coalition had themselves then assessed the event \u2013 determining it to be Credible in March 2018 and noting that \u201c two civilians were unintentionally killed.\n\u201d In a detailed letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own continuing refusal to accept civilian deaths : We looked at this incident very closely indeed .\nIt happened in an area of active fighting between Daesh and the Iraqi security forces , and neither the troops on the ground nor the coalition aircraft detected any signs of a civilian presence in the area either before or after the truck-bomb was destroyed .\nThe group of men , by their movements and behaviour , showed every sign of being Daesh fighters \u2013 particularly the presence of a motorcyclist , frequently used by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting\u2026 .\nWe therefore concluded that , if the group did indeed sustain casualties , they were extremely likely to have been Daesh terrorists ; we have no reason to believe , on the evidence available , that they were civilians .\nThe second RAF strike took place at Raqqa , Syria on August 13th 2017 .\nAccording to the US-led Coalition , 12 civilians died after \u201c Coalition aircraft engaged ISIS fighters utilizing a mortar system in a building used as a defensive fighting position.\n\u201d Among the victims locally named that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young daughter Limar .\nThe Coalition \u2019 s admission of 12 deaths in this event represented one of the highest confirmed tallies for the entire battle of Raqqa , which an Amnesty International/ Airwars investigation later concluded had seen at least 1,600 civilians killed by Coalition actions .\nOnce again accepting the strike but denying the civilian deaths , the MoD asserted : \u201c A single individual was seen on weapons system video moving in the area just prior to the impact of one of our weapons .\nThere is no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to one of the Daesh fighters engaged with the [ SDF ] .\nWe have certainly not seen any evidence that twelve civilian casualties were caused.\n\u201d In the final event , an RAF drone strike on January 20th 2018 killed one civilian nearby , according to an internal assessment by the US-led Coalition .\nOnce again , the British reached a different conclusion .\n\u201c Careful analysis was conducted of the available footage and of all available reports from the area .\nThese showed that there was no evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the footage identified a weapon being carried by the likely casualty .\nIt was therefore concluded that said individual was very likely a Daesh extremist and not a civilian.\n\u201d Senior defence officials confirmed to both the BBC and to Airwars that the UK presently requires what it calls \u2018 hard facts \u2019 when assessing civilian harm claims \u2013 an apparently higher standard even than the \u2018 beyond reasonable doubt \u2019 used by UK courts .\nCivilian casualty assessors within the US military instead use a \u2018 balance of probabilities \u2019 approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider local credible reports of civilian harm in their own investigations .\nIn effect , the UK has set the burden of proof so high that it is almost impossible for the MoD to reach a determination of civilian casualties \u2013 even when its most powerful ally the US concludes the exact opposite , critics say .\nChris Cole of the advocacy group Drone Wars UK accused the Ministry of Defence of overly focusing on managing public perceptions of war , rather than looking at appropriate levels of transparency : \u201c We end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these revelations show \u2013 a kind of internal structural self-denial , where it has become seemingly impossible for the MoD even to accept that civilian casualties have occurred.\n\u201d Belgium : \u201c Certainly not involved in all events \u201d Belgium , which ended its involvement in the war against ISIS in late 2017 , was potentially implicated in at least nine incidents which the US-led Coalition had deemed credible , an initial review concluded .\nWhile two of the strikes were later admitted by the UK , at least 23 civilians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Belgium was implicated , according to US officials .\nSeveral of these incidents were already known .\nIn May 2017 , a senior Belgian official had briefed Airwars that the Government was planning to admit two civilian harm events in Iraq earlier that year \u2013 one at al Qaim on February 27th , and a second event on March 21st near Mosul .\nBetween them , the US-led Coalition had itself concluded , the strikes had killed at least two civilians and injured four others .\nHowever Belgium then failed not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also publicly denied any civilian harm \u2013 which led in turn to a front page news story in De Morgen at the time .\nAsked in June 2019 to say whether its aircraft were responsible for officially declared civilian harm in up to nine incidents , the Belgian Ministry of Defence told Airwars by email : \u201c For the year 2017 , BAF [ Belgian Armed Forces ] was certainly not involved in all events .\nWith regard to the other data given , BAF was no longer present in theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 2017 .\nOur conclusion is that all ROEs [ rules of engagement ] were respected as confirmed by our federal court.\n\u201d That comment by Belgium \u2013 that it \u201c was certainly not involved in all events \u201d , appears to be tacit confirmation that their aircraft were involved in confirmed civilian harm events .\nHowever it remains unclear whether the Ministry accepts the Coalition \u2019 s own findings in any Credible case .\nIn its own investigation , De Morgen features Muhammad Sheikh Sa \u2019 ab , whose leg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airstrike on May 12th-13th 2017 .\nHe was one of the lucky ones .\nThe US-led Coalition acknowledges at least 10 deaths , while locals insist more people died .\nSurvivors and relatives may never know which military was responsible .\n\u201c Belgium and other Coalition countries can not bomb and then simply decide to look away from the deadly consequences .\nIf there is proof of civilian casualties , the Belgian government needs to take responsibility , \u201d argues Willem Staes of the Belgian advocacy organisation 11.11.11 .\n\u201c Mature democracies need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide civilian victims with adequate compensation and restitution.\n\u201d When the Dutch government admitted in November 2019 that its aircraft had been responsible for the deaths of approximately 70 civilians in Hawijah , Iraq almost five years earlier \u2013 a fact which had been hidden from both Parliament and the Dutch people \u2013 defence minister Ank Bijleveld promised new transparency standards .\nYet for much of this investigation , it seemed little had changed .\nIn June 2019 , Dutch defence officials were informed of two Coalition-confirmed civilian harm events in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those events was later confirmed to be a British strike , a second at al Bahrah , Syria on February 9th 2018 still implicated both the Dutch and French militaries .\n\u201c One civilian was unintentionally killed as a motorcycle entered the impact area moments before the strike , \u201d US military investigators had concluded in August of that year .\nIn late January 2020 , Dutch officials verbally informed Airwars that they would be neither confirming nor denying their involvement in the two Coalition-confirmed civilian harm events .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 13th defence officials informed Airwars and RTL Netherlands that they had not , in fact , been involved in either of the incidents , stating that \u201c In the interests of increased transparency , we can now explicitly answer your question about these air raids .\nAs far as the Ministry of Defense is aware , these attacks did not involve Dutch forces.\n\u201d It was also indicated that from now on , the Netherlands planned to be more transparent in such cases .\n\u201c Better late than never , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dutch military transparency and accountability .\nIf implemented fully , this should benefit past and future civilian victims seeking information , assistance or compensation and it should benefit parliamentary oversight of Dutch participation in military operations , \u201d says Wilbert van der Zeijden , a team coordinator focused on Protection of Civilians at PAX .\nAccording to an initial review , France was potentially implicated in up to nine Coalition-confirmed civilian harm events during 2017 and 2018 .\nWhile the UK has since explicitly confirmed its role in several of those strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which between them killed at least 24 civilians .\nDespite conducting more air and artillery actions than any Coalition member other than the United States , the French have yet to admit to a single civilian death in their six year war against so-called Islamic State .\nThat silence continues .\nAfter confirming receipt from Airwars in June 2019 of details of possible French civilian casualty events , the defence ministry then ceased communication \u2013 refusing to answer all emails ever since .\nMarie Forestier , who is part of the Lib\u00e9ration team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously reported for the newspaper that \u201c 200 allegations of civilian casualties potentially involving the French military have been investigated.\n\u201d Yet details of those investigations remain secret .\nOfficials do not deny that civilians have been killed by French actions .\nEven so , they insist that those numbers must remain buried within broader Coalition numbers .\nWith the United States , the UK and the Netherlands each explicitly denying involvement in a Coalition-confirmed event near al Bahrah village in Syria on February 9th 2018 , only France now appears liable .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm or deny their involvement in the confirmed death of a civilian that day , according to Lib\u00e9ration .\n\u201c The French Ministry of Defense has refused to answer direct questions and followup questions .\nAs there is a total lack of interest from MPs , media , and public opinion in France , the Army remains unchallenged and is not encouraged to reveal more information .\nAs a result , there is no scrutiny on French airstrikes and no accountability \u201d asserts reporter Marie Forestier , who has been examining French accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widening gulf between US and Europe Airwars is calling for a major review by European powers of their approach to civilian harm assessments \u2013 where the US now leads on best practice .\n\u201c US military officials are certainly no pushover when it comes to determining civilian harm .\nAround nine out of ten claimed civilian casualty events assessed by the Coalition since 2014 have been rejected , our analysis shows , \u201d says Dmytro Chupryna , deputy director of Airwars .\n\u201c Even so , this investigation reveals a complete unwillingness by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their own strikes \u2013 even where US military personnel determine otherwise .\nEurope \u2019 s civilian casualty assessment processes are presently unfit for purpose.\n\u201d On May 12th 2017 , during the fierce battle for Raqqa , at least 10 and as many as 20 civilians died when Coalition aircraft attacked Asadiya farm , to the north of the city .\nAccording to local reports the dead included Khalil Dhammaage ; Hassan Ismail Al Zeyabage ; Muhammad Al-Nasehage ; and Abu Baraa and his entire family .\nThree months later , Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike on ISIS fighters , it was assessed that 10 civilians were unintentionally killed in a building adjacent to the target.\n\u201d Yet to this day , neither Belgium nor France will say whether their aircraft killed those ten or more civilians .\nRemaining families have no chance of an explanation , an apology , or compensation .\nAccording to Dan Mahanty of CIVIC , \u201c the record now clearly shows that a public accounting of civilian harm carries few risks and more than a few benefits for belligerents .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency and accountability for the US-led Coalition is rendered less meaningful because a few governments prefer to hide in the crowd.\n\u201d In six weeks , the Pentagon is due by law to make its latest disclosure to Congress on civilian harm claims from US actions , covering a period in which at least 44 additional civilian harm events have been confirmed by the Coalition in Iraq and Syria .\nHow many of these will again emerge as non-US events remains to be seen .",

new online resource for Somalia , providing the most comprehensive look yet at more than a decade of US counterterrorism actions in eastern Africa , and associated civilian harm claims .\nThe nine month review has identified significantly higher levels of locally reported civilian harm than previously thought , with up to 280 non combatants alleged killed in US actions since 2007 .\nDeclared US actions and reported militant deaths are also sharply up .\nIn Spring 2019 , Airwars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journalism its own long running monitoring of US drone strikes and civilian harm in Somalia , Yemen and Pakistan , with some Somalia events dating back as far as 2007 .\nThe first step was to bring event monitoring across to Airwars \u2019 own standards .\nOver nine months , the team comprehensively reviewed several hundred declared and alleged US airstrikes and ground actions in Somalia , and 61 claimed civilian casualty incidents .\nEvent assessments were also significantly reoriented towards local Somali voices , adding many hundreds of new sources \u2013 including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts .\nAirwars also worked closely with other NGOs , researchers and investigative reporters to ensure that their own important findings were incorporated .\nThe result is the most comprehensive understanding yet of US military and CIA actions in Somalia against al Shabaab , ISIS and al Qaeda over a

Marshall Khalifa Haftar \u2019 s self-styled Libyan National Army ( LNA ) launched its offensive on Tripoli in April .\nHowever , what was intended to be a brief conflict soon turned into a protracted

describing his role in a deadly Mosul airstrike in 2015 which killed four family members .\nTranslation of an excerpt from the book Missie F-16 by Olof van Joolen and Silvan Schoonhoven ( 2019 , Nieuw Amsterdam ) Dutch F-16s conducted hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2018 .\nYet the Netherlands has been one of the least transparent countries when it comes to possible civilian casualties from US-led Coalition actions .\nPart of the reason for that Dutch secrecy has been an insistence that pilots and their families must be protected from retaliation \u2013 and until now the community has been tight , with almost no outside access .\nNow De Telegraaf journalists Olof van Joolen and Silvan Schoonhoven have managed to speak with Dutch pilots for their book Missie F-16 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published in November 2019 .\nThe book is a history of the Dutch use of F-16s in aerial warfare .\nThe authors interviewed pilots who flew during the Cold War ; the war in former Yugoslavia ; and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan .\nCovering more recent conflicts , they also interviewed pilots who were operating in Libya in 2011 ; and in the US-led Coalition against ISIS .\nThe book deals surprisingly frankly with pilot concern about civilian harm \u2013 and challenges an ongoing insistence on secrecy by the Dutch ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the authors .\nOlof van Joolen ( a defence reporter ) and Silvan Schoonhoven ( reporting on terrorism and security services ) published their book earlier than scheduled on November 13th 2019 , after Dutch media outlets NOS and NRC broke their story about the Netherlands being responsible for at least 70 civilian deaths in Hawijah , Iraq in June 2015 .\nIn response to that investigation , Dutch Minister of

who lost his brother , wife , daughter and nephew in the attack \u2013 as well as the pilot who had dropped the bomb on the Razzo house .\nPreviously , it had been though that a US aircraft had carried out the attack .\nWhat was it like interviewing Stefan , the pilot who dropped the bomb on the Razzo house ?\nSchoonhoven : \u201c We realised that he was completely drowning in this story .\nHe was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish .\nHe couldn \u2019 t share this with his family .\nThese past weeks have been very tough for him \u2013 to see a videotaped interview with Basim Razzo .\nHe had read about him , but not seen his face , let alone see him cry.\n\u201d Van Joolen : \u201c He really would have liked to see this handled properly .\nHe feels terrible about it .\nPeople expect some master plan from the Ministry of Defence in incidents like this .\nTrust me , that wasn \u2019 t the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers In a chapter on civilian casualties , pilot Jeffrey , nickname \u201c Scatman \u201d , is asked about what he thinks of Airwars estimates of civilian casualties .\n\u201c Airwars delivers nonsensical numbers \u201d , claims Scatman .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe that the American [ military \u2019 s lower ] numbers are wrong .\nIt just doesn \u2019 t work that way .\nI know exactly where I flew myself and the exact metre where my bomb fell .\nHow do they think it works ?\nThat you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later : \u201c No , it wasn \u2019 t me \u201d ?\nAnd that you can get away with it ?\n\u201d [ Editor \u2019 s note : More than half of all Coalition-confirmed civilian harm events during 2019 were referrals from Airwars , with the alliance itself previously failing to identify concerns .\nIt is clear that pilots are often unaware of the consequences of their actions . ]\nThis quote seems quite ironic now we know that this is exactly what happened for more than four years with the Hawija case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how he just can not believe , from his own experiences , that the general Airwars numbers are correct .\nHe thinks that they would have seen if indeed so many civilian casualties had fallen in the more than 2,000 airstrikes that the Netherlands carried out.\n\u201d Yet , you did not further dive into that discrepancy between the Airwars numbers and the official Coalition numbers .\nHow did you make sure that this book did not become an uncritical outlet for pilots ?\nVan Joolen : \u201c I think that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , that is not the case .\nWe also talked to Bassim Razzo .\nWe wouldn \u2019 t have if we just wanted to write a glorious story about pilots .\nAs a journalist , you can conclude that there is an Airwars number and that there is an official number , and you should mention both .\nWe did that.\n\u201d Schoonhoven : \u201c And if we were an outlet for the Dutch air forces , we would not even have mentioned Airwars.\n\u201d But you did not further dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSchoonhoven : \u201c There is a remarkable discrepancy .\nI can not explain that .\nI believe Airwars is a legit organisation , but at the same time , I believe what Scatman says .\nThat it is impossible to throw a bomb and then pretend you did not throw it .\nIt \u2019 s always going to come out.\n\u201d The Ministry of Defence , when asked about their lack of transparency for airstrikes in Syria and Iraq , has continually pointed to the safety of pilots and families .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their full names and even pilots who were active during the fight against ISIS are pictured in their aircraft .\nHow did you experience this safety issue when interviewing pilots themselves ?\nVan Joolen : \u201c They generally don \u2019 t have issues with being photographed .\nThey are not really clearly distinguishable people .\nOnce they put on their jeans rather than their uniform , you couldn \u2019 t point them out .\nThey are more worried about their full names being published .\nNow you might have a photo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online and very hard to connect to his real name .\nWith a full name , you could find his address.\n\u201d \u201c There is a lot of , not sure if it is the right word , trauma among these guys .\nThe death of Jordanian pilot Moaz Al Kasabeh , who was captured by ISIS and burned to death in a cage , really left an impact .\nWe interviewed a Dutch pilot who just spoke to Al Kasabeh on the military base in Jordan before Al Kasabeh went on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among pilots is for their families .\nTheir worst fear is being \u2018 over there \u2019 and that there is someone back home standing near their wife , mother or children .\nThat is when they feel threatened.\n\u201d How did officials react when they heard you were writing a book about this topic , as they have been notoriously secretive ?\nVan Joolen : \u201c I need to give my compliments to the Dutch air force .\nWhenever you publish something that involves still active military personnel , they need to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our research have they said that we could not write something down or should change something.\n\u201d \u201c However , something interesting occurred during our research .\nPilots continuously talked to us about \u2018 confirmed kills \u2019 .\nThey would say something like : \u201c One night I had 50 confirmed kills !\n\u201d The Brits have been publishing reports of these confirmed kills .\nSo we asked the air force if we could receive a list as well .\nAnd then they said : \u201c We do not have such a list.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe pilots kept referring to \u2018 confirmed kills \u2019 , but there is no official record of this ?\nAnd if the Brits can publish such a list , why can \u2019 t we ?\n\u201d Do you think the pilots themselves are receptive towards more transparency ?\nVan Joolen : \u201c Absolutely , one hundred per cent .\nIn fact , it would help many of them .\nIn the book we write for example write about the case of Uruzgan , Afghanistan .\nBack home , people thought our men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in fact , they were risking their lives and losing their colleagues .\nBecause it was sold as a \u201c school building mission \u201d .\nThat is breaking soldiers .\nIt is incredibly important for military personnel that people at home know what they were doing , so that when they come back , they can deal with their traumas.\n\u201d What then do you think is the main issue with improving transparency ?\nVan Joolen : \u201c The interesting question is : where is the bottleneck when it comes to transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews we have had , I think the issue is with the Department of Defence , rather than in the armed forces .\nThere \u2019 s this quote in the book by Johan van Deventer , who is currently acting head of operations .\nHe said : \u201c I handed in a list in my final report as detachment commandant in the fight against ISIS , in which I explicitly stated how many fighters , buildings and vehicles we eliminated.\n\u201d They did not like that in The Hague .\n\u201c Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him .\nSome got angry .\nThat is a very telling quote about the mindset in The Hague.\n\u201d \u201c That is one of the points we are trying to make with this book : stop with all the strange secrecy .\nAdmit that if you sent a unit of F-16s , you are sending our most effective weapon to do its job .\nYou should be transparent about that , so that people know what you are doing there .\nI found it very shocking to hear from military personnel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge MPs had about the reality of war .\nThey really have no idea.\n\u201d In an interview with Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad on January 24th , 2020 , Basim Razzo , the survivor of the deadly airstrike on his house in Mosul , stated that he still had not received an apology from the Dutch government , despite the public acknowledgement of Dutch responsibility .\nAs Mr Razzo noted : \u201c I can \u2019 t think of a reason why I haven \u2019 t heard from the Dutch government .\nOut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledging responsibility , I expect them to contact me and do the right thing .\nI think I am entitled to an official apology and then a real compensation for the loss of four lives and two houses.\n\u201d Due to the lack of action on the side of the Dutch state , Razzo is now being supported by human rights lawyer Liesbeth

to Congress for Iraq , Syria and Somalia for the past year were Airwars referrals , official records show The Department of Defense ( DoD ) informed Congress on May 6th that US forces in Afghanistan , Syria , Iraq and Somalia had between them killed at least 132 civilians and injured 91 more during 2019 .\nThe Pentagon also reported a further 79 historical deaths from its actions in Syria and Iraq during 2017-18 .\nThe 22-page Annual Report on Civilian Casualties In Connection With United States Military Operations is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law by Congress since 2018 .\nAccording to the report \u2013 which included details of continuing Pentagon efforts to improve both accountability and transparency for civilian harm \u2013 \u201c U.S .\nforces also protect civilians because it is the moral and ethical thing to do .\nAlthough civilian casualties are a tragic and unavoidable part of war , the U.S. military is steadfastly committed to limiting harm to civilians.\n\u201d During 2019 , the majority of declared civilian deaths from US actions took place in Afghanistan .\nAccording to the Pentagon , 108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 incidents .\nFourteen of those events involved US ground forces .\nThat casualty tally represented a significant undercount according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) , which has been comprehensively monitoring civilian deaths from all parties for more than a decade .\nAccording to UNAMA \u2019 s own Annual Report , at least 559 civilians were killed and 786 injured by international military actions during 2019 \u2013 almost all by airstrikes .\nOfficially confirmed civilian deaths from US actions in Iraq and Syria fell steeply \u2013 down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , to 101 deaths conceded in the latest report .\nThat sharp reduction was partly expected , given the significant reduction in battle tempo following the bloody capture of both Mosul and Raqqa in 2017 .\nHowever , in early 2019 very significant civilian fatalities were locally alleged from Coalition air and artillery strikes during the final stages of the war \u2013 only a fraction of which have been admitted .\nOf the 73 known civilian harm claims against the US-led Coalition during 2019 , Airwars presently estimates that at least 460 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely died .\nHowever in its own report to the Pentagon , the US has conceded just 22 civilian deaths for the year across Iraq and Syria , in eleven events .\nThe Defense Department \u2019 s report reveals other worrying trends .\nOf the 21 historical cases officially conceded from US actions for 2017 over the past year , 18 had been Airwars referrals .\nYet every single allegation referred by Airwars to the Coalition for both 2018 and 2019 was rejected \u2013 amounting to many hundreds of dismissed local claims .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparent move by the US-led Coalition away from engaging with external sources marks a backward step , which the organisation plans to take up with both Congress and DoD officials .\n\u201c Almost all of the deaths conceded by the US in Iraq and Syria for 2019 represented self referrals from pilots and analysts , with external sources cited on only three occasions .\nMany hundreds of civilian deaths which were credibly reported by local communities appear to have been ignored , \u201d says Woods .\n\u201c This goes against the Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with external NGOs including monitors , and we will be asking for an urgent explanation from officials of this apparent backward step.\n\u201d The Pentagon \u2019 s latest report to Congress also brings further clarity to a controversial June 2017 Coalition attack in Mosul , Iraq which killed 35 members of the same extended family \u2013 including 14 children , nine women and two respected imams .\nIn January 2019 the Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) accepted responsibility for some of those deaths \u2013 confirming that a strike by one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians .\nHowever the ADF also made clear that there was a second attack on the location by another Coalition ally that day \u2013 the identity of which was until now not known .\nIt its May 6th report to Congress , the Pentagon revealed that US aircraft conducted that second strike , additionally killing at least 11 civilians at the scene .\nIn February 2019 , surviving family elder Engineer Amjad al-Saffar told the Sydney Morning Herald : \u201c The level of accuracy of the bombing had always indicated to us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Iraqi forces , because the house was targeted twice at the same point without any damage to the neighbouring building , and with very high accuracy.\n\u201d Other than this one case , the Pentagon \u2019 s report to Congress also revealed that all civilian harm events conceded by the US-led Coalition for Iraq and Syria over the past 12 months had been caused by US forces .\nThis contrasted with the previous report \u2013 which had inadvertently \u2018 outed \u2019 fourteen strikes by America \u2019 s European allies which according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 civilians \u2013 but which the UK , France and Belgium refused to acknowledge .\nIt remains unclear whether the Coalition \u2019 s civilian casualty cell has now ceased assessments of claims against other nations within the alliance .\nTwo more civilian deaths from US actions in Somalia were officially conceded on April 27th , as US Africa Command issued its first ever quarterly civilian casualty report .\nThose same deaths were also reported to Congress two weeks later .\nThe newly admitted event \u2013 which according to local reports involved the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the injuring of at least three more civilians \u2013 relates to a US strike on the al Shabaab-occupied town of Kunyo Barrow on February 23rd 2019 .\nAFRICOM had originally dismissed the claim .\nBut it reopened an assessment after Airwars submitted a detailed dossier on the incident in January 2020 , including what were believed to be precise coordinates for where casualties took place .\nThe latest admission has doubled both the number of cases and deaths publicly admitted by AFRICOM , during its sometimes controversial 13-year campaign to defeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those four deaths remain dwarfed by Airwars \u2019 own current estimate of at least 70 civilians killed in 29 separate US actions in Somalia since 2007 .\nThe US military \u2019 s campaign in Somalia has intensified significantly under President Donald Trump , with at least 186 declared actions since 2017 \u2013 more than four times the

civilian harm from its actions in Somalia \u2013 leading to complaints of poor accountability .\nIn April 2019 , AFRICOM conceded its first civilian casualty event \u2013 though also had to admit to

unexploded ordnance In an extraordinary reversal , the opposition Libyan National Army ( LNA ) \u2013 believed until recently to be the dominant military power in Libya today \u2013 has been routed from much of its western territory in just a few weeks .\nRetreating LNA forces abandoned tanks , attack helicopters and other advanced weaponry as they fled the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) and its Turkish backers .\nIn mid-January things had looked very bleak indeed for Tripoli \u2019 s GNA .\nGeneral Khalifa Haftar \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city the GNA had symbolically taken from ISIS with US support back in 2016 .\nHaftar \u2019 s opposition Libyan National Army was slowly tightening its grip on Tripoli \u2019 s suburbs ; and it looked like an equally bloody and destructive battle for Benghazi could be looming .\nHowever a ceasefire deal between Turkey and Russia came to the rescue of the GNA alliance \u2013 still more resembling a loose coalition of militias than a national government .\nTurkey used that ceasefire to smuggle drones and advanced air defences into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blatant violation of the UN arms embargo .\nThese turned out to be a game changer , given that the United Arab Emirates and Russia , the LNA \u2019 s strongest backers , were either unwilling or incapable of matching Turkey \u2019 s support .\nThe LNA quickly lost its air superiority in early February and later also its air defences , as Turkish drones took out several state-of-the-art Russian Pantsir anti-air systems .\nHow was the LNA \u2019 s previous air superiority so quickly dismantled ?\n\u201c First , the Pantsirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed over to LNA crews who were under-trained and ineffective .\nAnd strong electronic warfare , most likely with a KORAL system , by the Turkish , \u201d explains Oded Berkowitz , an analyst at MAX Security .\nDespite repeated reports of the UAE flying in supplies to Benghazi , the LNA quickly found itself on the ropes .\nIts most significant loss was that of the Al Watiyah air base close to the Tunisian border on May 18th .\nAl Watiyah is not only a proper military air base , as opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for civilian purposes \u2013 it also gives Turkey a potential foothold in northern Africa , enabling it to station aircraft there .\nAfter the loss of Al Watiyah in late May , events moved quickly .\nIn the first week of June the GNA completed their rout of Haftar \u2019 s forces with the capture of Tripoli International Airport and Qasr Bin Gashir \u2013 finally breaking a fifteen month siege of the capital .\nMeanwhile , Russian mercenaries with the Wagner Group were reported to have abandoned Haftar \u2019 s forces , allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake .\nAccording to the GNA Ministry of Interior , 25 members of its demining teams had been killed between May 21st and June 4th .\nSurprisingly , despite the withdrawal of the Wagner mercenaries , Haftar \u2019 s forces had received up to 14 Russian fighter jets as reported by US Africa Command in a bellicose public statement .\nA UN source told Airwars that some of these planes were supplied from Belarus via Russia and on to Syria , where with the addition of some old Syrian air force jets they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowed by the US military .\nThe intervention by Russia so far has been limited and less overt compared to Syria , and may have been intended as a show of strength to keep the GNA from moving into the southwestern Fezzan and Cyrenaica in the East .\nRussia \u2019 s decision to supply attack aircraft to the LNA may also have tipped the United States into overtly backing the UN-backed GNA for the first time in several years .\nHaftar \u2019 s last bastion near Tripoli was Tarhuna , some 65km southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly shelled the city in recent weeks and many expected a bloodbath as Tarhuna \u2013 historically loyal to the Gaddafi regime \u2013 had sided with Haftar through its local Kaniyat Brigade .\nHowever instead of fighting , LNA forces chaotically withdrew .\nImages circulating on social media show the full extent of arms embargo breaches in Libya in recent years , with Russian helicopters and tanks , Chinese MANPADS and anti-UAV guns as well as Serbian mortar shells among the discoveries , earning the nickname of \u201c biggest arms convention in the world.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ LNA \u2019 s fourteen month failed Tripoli offensive can only be described as devastating .\nAirwars has found that 60 % of all reported civilian harm from air and artillery strikes since 2012 occurred since April 4th 2019 .\nPrior to the siege , Airwars had recorded a minimum of 298 civilian deaths , while another 439 have been reported over the past 14 months .\nSome 276 of those deaths have either been attributed to the LNA or to its allies , while 87 civilian deaths were allegedly caused by the GNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rise , with civilian harm from GNA and Turkish actions now escalating as they gain the upper hand .\nBut it is not only airstrikes that pose a grave threat to civilians .\nThe LNA and its Wagner allies left behind a substantial amount of mines , IEDs and unexploded ordnance .\nOne of the many civilian victims is Saleh , brother of former Airwars Libya Researcher Osama Mansour , who was injured when checking on the family home in the south of Tripoli .\n\u201c My brother got there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our house the neighbour removed a branch of a tree and a mine went off .\nMy brother was hit in the neck and the teeth , lost a lot of blood as well and was unconscious for a couple of minutes , \u201d Osama tells us .\n\u201c The neighbour lost more blood and has been in surgery twice already , and they still need to remove two pieces of shrapnel from his liver , \u201d he adds .\nThe event is one of many in south Tripoli , with civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us a very insecure feeling to go back after all the incidents , \u201d Osama says .\nBesides military mistakes , old grievances and retaliation may soon play a role as well : \u201c There are legitimate concerns about abuses by GNA forces against civilians in newly captured territory .\nHowever , GNA officials are mindful of these concerns and they \u2019 ll be working to avoid such abuses , \u201d claims Mohamed Eljarh , a well-connected Libya independent analyst .\nSo far , it seems the UN-backed government is struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of looting and damage to properties emerging over the weekend .\nWhen GNA forces took Tarhuna from the LNA they also uncovered 106 dead bodies , including children and women , in a hospital morgue .\nSome had allegedly been executed with shots to the head , though so far the exact circumstances of the deaths are unclear .\nAlthough the routing of the LNA marks Libya \u2019 s biggest military turning point in several years , the future remains unclear .\nWhile the GNA presently has the upper hand , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of ideologically diverse militias united by a common enemy and now strengthened by Turkey \u2019 s intervention .\nTensions are likely to arise within the GNA as the shaky coalition adapts to holding more power and territory .\nIn terms of military goals Mohammed Eljarh says he expects that \u201c Turkey and the GNA will continue to expand their territorial control .\nControl of key oil facilities in the southwest in particular will be high on the agenda .\nThe GNA is trying to restart some of the oil production from al-Sharara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GNA \u2019 s territorial ambitions go also depends on the LNA \u2019 s international backers , as Wolfram Lacher from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs explains : \u201c At a minimum , GNA-aligned forces will seek to ensure that Haftar loyalists can no longer use Bani Walid [ 160km south of Tripoli ] as a logistics hub .\nBut it is likely that they will now attempt an offensive on Sirte or Jufra.\n\u201d Yet initial attempts by the GNA to take Sirte have failed \u2013 met with staunch resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggesting the LNA and its backers may seek to draw a line at Gaddafi \u2019 s birthplace .\nFollowing these newly established facts on the ground , both parties have now agreed to resume the stalled 5+5 talks in Geneva , UNSMIL announced on June 2nd .\nHaftar has reportedly lost major support from his international backers , especially Egypt .\nPresident Sisi brought Aguila Saleh , President of the House of Representatives in Tobruk , and Khalifa Haftar to the table and announced a ceasefire on June 6th .\nThat agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Only if Russian and Emirati intervention stops the GNA offensives could we see growing calls for negotiations within the GNA coalition , \u201d Lacher says .\nPerhaps ominously , a day later Egypt was reported to have deployed M1A2 Abrams tanks to the Libyan border .\nThe UAE for now remains Haftar \u2019 s strongest backer , while Russia seems keen to at least hold a stake in Libya , as the recent delivery of fighter planes shows .\nBut that move may backfire \u2013 with the US now overtly resisting Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UAE to the negotiating table .\n\u201c Haftar \u2019 s defeat in western Libya will have wide-ranging implications for his coalition .\nMany who supported him because they hoped to sweep to power with him will now reconsider their allegiances , \u201d Lacher asserts .\n\u201c The same goes for his adversaries , among whom Haftar \u2019 s offensive had served as a unifying threat and kept distrust and rivalries among them in check.\n\u201d It currently seems unlikely that either side can control all of Libya .\nAnd distrust between rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a ceasefire deal unlikely .\nThe amount of weapons discovered around Tripoli also serves as an indicator that Libya \u2019 s on-and-off civil war , now in its tenth year , could still be far from over .", "author": "Oliver Imhof",

.\n\u201c The reason why Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it wanted .\nTheir endgame has always been to secure the integrity of the Syrian regime , \u201d argues Alexey Khlebnikov , a Middle East expert and

getting every centimetre .\nThere were and there are two major goals : securing the M5 , which connects Aleppo and Damascus , and the M4 highway , connecting Aleppo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Turkey did less well out of that agreement .\nGerhard Mangott , a professor at the University of Innsbruck specialising in international relations and security in the post-Soviet region , notes : \u201c The ceasefire is a compromise between Russian and Turkish interests , with poor results for Turkey and good results for Russia .\nTurkey had set an ultimatum to the Syrian government to withdraw to the front line of April 2019 , when Syrian and allied forces started their offensive in Idlib .\nDue to Russian pressure , Turkey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the last remaining opposition stronghold , north west Syria was targeted heavily during a three-month campaign by the Assad regime and Russia as they sought to gain control of the region .\nRussian-backed pro-government forces ( made up of Syrian Government forces , Hezbollah , and allied armed groups ) attempted to push into both Idlib and Aleppo Governorates , and defeat remaining anti-government rebels .\nThe beginning of the offensive saw pro-government forces make quick advances against rebel troops .\nBy the end of December 2019 , the Assad government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arat Al Nu \u2019 man countryside including Jarjnaz , the largest town in the area ; and had completely encircled the main Turkish observation point in Sarman .\nThen , following a short-lived ceasefire between January 9th and 15th , the Syrian Government made some of its most significant advances in Idlib since the civil war began in 2011 .\nBy January 28th , pro-government forces had managed to capture Ma \u2019 arat Al Nu \u2019 man , a city of major strategic and symbolic importance due to its position on the Aleppo-Damascus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country \u2019 s main economic arteries to areas under government control in northwestern Syria .\nJust eight days later , the town of Saraqib \u2013 another locale which had served as a bastion against the Assad Government for many years \u2013 was captured .\nThe following weeks saw more government advances including the full capture of the province of Aleppo for the first time since the outbreak of the civil war .\nRussian airpower has been crucial to each pro-government advance .\nHowever , these military victories came at a catastrophic cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleppo .\nHeavily populated urban areas were pummelled before each incursion , with almost no respite for residents .\nDuring the three months of the campaign , Russia was allegedly involved in 250 separate civilian harm incidents \u2013 averaging more than three events every day .\nThese airstrikes led to between 423 and 556 civilian deaths and the injuring of up to 1,137 more , Airwars monitoring of local sources indicates .\nAt least 128 children were killed during the campaign \u2013 more than a quarter of all tracked fatalities \u2013 showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ruthless air campaign .\nAdditionally , crucial civilian infrastructure was hit numerous times .\nSchools were targeted on at least 15 occasions , while hospitals and medical centres were struck at least nine times .\nThis targeting of civilian infrastructure by Assad and Russia was not new .\nAccording to the World Health Organisation , there have been 83 attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since April 2019 .\nThe Idlib campaign triggered a widespread displacement crisis in northern Syria .\nBy the end of the assault , at least 980,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , were forced to flee the violence .\nAccording to Mark Lowcock , UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs , these displaced people were struggling to survive in what he described as \u201c horrific conditions \u201d .\nThe fighting in Idlib eventually stopped after Turkey escalated its own operations against pro-Assad government forces , following a devastating airstrike on a Turkish infantry battalion on the road between al-Bara and Balyun , which had left 32 Turkish soldiers dead and many others wounded .\nFollowing this event , Ankara took the bold decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebels .\nThe ferociousness of Turkey \u2019 s intervention was unprecedented , with Turkish forces launching a barrage of attacks on pro-regime positions , destroying dozens of military vehicles , equipment and several Russian-made air defence systems .\nThese attacks devastated the Syrian Government , with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that 170 pro-regime forces died .\nTurkish defence minister Hulusi Akar put the toll far higher \u2013 claiming that Turkish forces had destroyed two Syrian Su-24 fighter jets , two drones , 135 tanks , and five air defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,500 fighters loyal to the Syrian government .\nThe risk of being embroiled in an all-out confrontation with Turkey forced the hands of both the Syrian and Russian governments , and prompted a formal ceasefire agreement between Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Vladmir Putin of Russia .\nWhile the eventual ceasefire provided a much-needed respite for civilians in northwestern Syria , millions continued to suffer from the after-effects of the brutal campaign .\nAnd with the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of abating in the region , refugees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcrowded camps , may remain most at risk of suffering from the virus .\nKhlebnikov at RIAC says he does not , however , think the Covid-19 crisis was the main driver of the ceasefire : \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say it is a game-changer or a strong factor in this ceasefire .\nThe Ukraine crisis did not impact Russia \u2019 s foreign policy , even though the economy was under great distress .\nSo why would Covid-19 ?\nIt might affect the intensity of the conflict in the long run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaders are unable to meet in person.\n\u201d Elizabeth Tsurkov , a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a Syria expert , agrees : \u201c I don \u2019 t think the Covid-19 crisis impacted the calculations of the warring parties in this conflict.\n\u201d That the ceasefire has lasted following the Covid-19 outbreak might seem paradoxical , given that both Russia and Turkey recently increased their involvement in Libya .\nHowever , those contributions are relatively small for now , compared to Syria .\nThat said , the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria \u2013 with Russia and Turkey again on opposite sides \u2013 and also a continuation of the civil war on different soil , as Syrian mercenaries recruited by both Turkey and Russia now fight each other in the Maghreb .\nTalks between Moscow and Ankara to explore a deal that might see the fates of Syria and Libya connected have been put off for now .\n\u201c Costs of violating the ceasefire are much higher now \u201d Previous Syria ceasefires have been fairly short-lived .\nSo why is the Idlib pause still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The situation on the ground is different from two years ago .\nIdlib is now the only lasting stronghold of opposition armed groups and terrorists .\nAnd a ceasefire during a civil war , it is not a literal thing .\nThere are certain violations , \u201d asserts Khlebnikov .\nAccording to his own estimates , there were 80 violations of the ceasefire in the first half of May .\nEven so , Khlebnikov sees the ceasefire as quite successful : \u201c Since March 5th , the violence fell significantly .\nThe first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 5 or 7 kilometres long , now they are 25 kilometres long .\nThis builds trust ; and the Russian and Turkish militaries are getting used to interacting with each other on hostile ground .\nThat creates a certain restraint for [ other ] armed groups to escalate.\n\u201d Mangott also views the results of the ceasefire as so far positive : \u201c I think it will last .\nRussia is in a difficult economic and financial situation , the GDP will drop by 10 % this year .\nThere will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current spending priority is on social causes [ at home ] to take care of the economic crisis , so there is no money for an escalation in Syria.\n\u201d In mid June there were some reports of violations of the ceasefire , with Russian airstrikes on Idlib and reports of civilian casualties .\nThese appeared to be in retaliation for attempts by the HTS to seize several villages , and attack Russian targets , however .\nDr Elizabeth Tsurkov remains positive : \u201c This is the first time in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regime will be punished for violating it .\nTurkish drones will be up the skies , killing soldiers .\nThe costs will be much higher for them .\nIt is difficult to make predictions , because there are too many uncertain factors right now , also looking at the elections in the US coming up .\nBut I think the ceasefire will last for the rest of 2020.\n\u201d Tsurkov adds : \u201c The area north of the M4 highway will remain out of regime hands for the foreseeable future .\nUntil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will essentially be annexed into Turkey .\nWe are already seeing the dynamics of that in northern Aleppo.\n\u201d Amplifying fears in Damascus of a de facto annexation , in mid June Turkish-backed opposition groups introduced the Turkish Lira and the US dollar as local currencies in cities and towns across Idlib governorate in an effort , they claimed , to stabilise the local economy after the ongoing depreciation of the Syrian pound .\nWhenever it might end , Khlebnikov sees the ongoing ceasefire between Russia , the regime and Turkey in northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is definitely not a final solution .\nThere are two options with the ceasefire : it will be cancelled , or updated .\nI don \u2019 t think there will be any major breaches.\n\u201d \u201c On the other hand , there is a certain risk of escalation , because if Turkey won \u2019 t be able to deliver on its promises to clear the buffer zone , that may become a legitimate reason for Russia and the Syrian army to launch operations.\n\u201d But , warns Khlebnikov : \u201c In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15.000 troops and upped military equipment .\nIt is amassing its forces in Idlib .\nAny fight with Turkey will be a disaster for Russia.\n\u201d With a mass outbreak of the Covid-19 virus still threatening Syria \u2013 with its heavily weakened health care system after nearly a decade of war \u2013 a fight between Russia and Turkey on Syrian territory would not only carry great risk for Moscow .\nIt is likely that Syrian civilians would bear the greatest losses , once again .", "author": "Oliver Imhof", "url":

transparency moves", "content": "Ministry of Defence says it is revising current civilian harm reporting procedures The Dutch Minister of Defence , Ank Bijleveld , has reported to Parliament on the latest progress made by the Government in improving transparency regarding civilian harm as a result of Dutch military actions .\nCoupled with other steps taken in the months after the Hawijah scandal , the Netherlands appears slowly to be shedding its reputation as one of the least transparent members of the international Coalition fighting so-called Islamic State .\nIn her June 29th letter to Parliament , the Minister laid out a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency and accountability .\nThe letter followed on from a fourth parliamentary debate on May 14th on the Hawijah case .\nBack in October 2019 , it was revealed that the Dutch military had been responsible for a 2015 airstrike in Iraq , which had led to the deaths of an estimated 70 civilians .\nThe Government had then withheld that fact from the public for more than four years .\nAn important topic during the fourth debate was the April 21st release of key US military documents on the Hawijah incident .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ those previously classified documents to Dutch media , after a judicial procedure following an unanswered Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request .\nFour months earlier , Minister Bijleveld had filed a request with her US counterpart Defense Secretary Mark Esper publicly to share the documents , including the American DoD \u2019 s own investigation into Hawijah .\nShe received a negative response to that request on February 28th .\nHowever , MPs say they found it difficult to understand why the Minister was not given permission to share the documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press just two months later .\nThe contents of those documents revealed that US officials had been aware that an airstrike on the targeted ISIS IED factory in Hawijah could possibly present a significant risk to civilians .\nCIA informants had , for example , warned the Coalition about civilians living in the area .\nFurthermore , while Minister Bijleveld has continuously stated that all procedures leading up to the Hawijah strike were followed correctly , the US investigation revealed that Coalition target development processes had been amended after the deadly event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis was not reported to Parliament by Dutch defence officials .\nIt was in this context that the Minister , once again , recently had to explain herself in front of a clearly frustrated Parliament .\nDuring the May 14th debate , Bijleveld said she shared the frustration of MPs regarding what was characterised as poor communication from the Americans and the Coalition .\nIn her letter of June 29th to MPs , the Minister wrote that she had met with her US counterpart Mark Esper earlier that day and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplored the course of events , endorsed the importance of transparency and indicated that his department had done everything possible to provide the correct information.\n\u201d One major criticism of Hawijah was that the Dutch \u2018 red card holder \u2019 had agreed on the strike taking place \u2013 despite the known risk to civilians in the area .\nThe Red Card Holder ( RCH ) was the Dutch representative in the Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar , with the option of vetoing actions which fell outside Dutch rules of engagement .\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the instructions for the Dutch Red Card Holder have been updated in line with a successful parliamentary motion .\nFrom now on , she noted , the red card holder must proactively request important information related to future airstrikes the Dutch military may carry out .\nIn the case of Hawijah , the Dutch RCH was , for example , unaware that the Americans had intelligence suggesting that a possible airstrike posed a risk to civilians .\nThe Minister \u2019 s latest letter also states that the MoD expects to complete its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in the second half of 2020 .\nThe process of informing the Public Prosecutor \u2019 s Office ( OM ) has already been updated : from now on , the OM will be informed as soon as the MoD starts an investigation into any civilian harm allegation .\nIn the case of Hawijah , it took Defensie nine months to inform the OM .\nOn June 23rd , the minister additionally proposed a new procedure to inform Parliament of any investigations into civilian harm during future Dutch missions .\nWhereas the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minister now suggests that due to \u201c the importance the parliament attaches to public transparency \u201d , the default will instead be for the defence ministry to publicly inform parliament of such cases , unless this \u201c is impossible , according to the Minister.\n\u201d According to Lauren Gould , Assistant Professor in Conflict Studies at Utrecht University and project leader of the Intimacies of Remote Warfare project , the Minister \u2019 s proposal contains several loopholes : \u201c This is history just repeating itself : the Minister uses the catchphrase \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is exempt from being transparent or being held to account for a lack of transparency .\nIt should be clearly defined when the parliament finds it acceptable that a minister does not inform the broader public .\nThe minister will have to prove that these exceptional circumstances are at play.\n\u201d Gould continued : \u201c Furthermore , the question remains : what information will Defensie share with parliament ?\nThey \u2019 ve stated multiple times that as a small country , the Netherlands is unequipped to independently investigate the nature of targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s nothing in the procedure about how they will tackle one of the main problems in the Hawijah case : that crucial information collected by the US about Dutch military actions was withheld from the Dutch parliament and public.\n\u201d In her June 29th letter to Parliament , the minister also noted that on June 10th , Defensie personnel had spoken with Basim Razzo , a survivor of another 2015 Dutch airstrike , which had killed four relatives when Mr Razzo \u2019 s Mosul home was bombed by a Dutch F-16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMr Razzo himself was severely injured .\nAccording to Minister Bijleveld , discussions are continuing with Mr Razzo \u2019 s counsel , human rights lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld .\nEarlier , the Minister had promised to explore possibilities to voluntarily aid local projects for the devastated community in Hawijah .\nThere have , it \u2019 s now emerged , been talks between the Dutch embassy and local authorities on the matter .\nThe Minister writes that Defensie has identified several local organisations operating in Hawijah ; and that these have been asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to inform Parliament of developments after the summer recess .\n\u201c To prevent this information from reaching Parliament in another manner \u201d , the Minister also note that local authorities in Hawijah have expressed concerns about possible undefined radiation after the Dutch airstrike in June 2015 .\nAccording to Bijleveld however , the munitions used in the attack were not capable of producing radiation .\nBoth the MoD and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs say they will explore whether the concerns of Hawijans can be verified in another manner .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by human rights lawyer Zegveld in the name of Hawijah \u2019 s victims .\nAccording to Bijleveld , the Dutch Cabinet has sent a note of sympathy to the victims and their relatives , but claimed that an offer to begin a conversation was rejected .\nExplaining that rejection , lawyer Zegveld told Airwars : \u201c [ The Minister ] wanted to have a one on one conversation \u2018 human being to human being \u2019 with the Hawijah victim living in the Netherlands .\nHe was expected to come alone , without me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to that .\nIt \u2019 s not about the person Bijleveld , but about her responsibility as a Minister.\n\u201d Along with the Minister \u2019 s latest June 29th letter to Parliament , the MoD has now also published its weekly reports of all anti-ISIS airstrikes in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2018 as open data , after recent requests from Airwars and the Open State Foundation .\n\u201c While Airwars welcomes this next step towards a more transparent Defensie , the content of the data is still below standard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Other Coalition allies such as the UK already report the specific date , targets and near locations of their airstrikes .\nFor Defensie to become more transparent , improving their reporting on airstrikes really is one of the first steps to take .\n\u201d", "author": "Laurie Treffers", "url": "https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/minister-announces-fresh-transparency-moves/", "published": "Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:12 +0000",

.\nIt is a cliff ' , warns Special Rapporteur The US assassination of Qasem Soleimani , the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) , in Baghdad in January 2020 , was unlawful on several counts , according to a new report submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council by its expert on extrajudicial killings .\nDr Agnes Callamard , the current UN Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Executions , asserts in her latest report that Soleimani \u2019 s controversial assassination by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport on January 3rd 2020 had violated international law in several ways .\nNoting that the US drone strike had also killed several Iraqi military personnel , Dr Callamard notes that \u201c By killing General Soleimani on Iraqi soil without first obtaining Iraq \u2019 s consent , the US violated the territorial integrity of Iraq.\n\u201d The Special Rapporteur also argues that by failing to demonstrate that Soleimani represented an imminent threat to the United States \u2013 and instead focusing on his past actions dating back to 2006 \u2013 that his killing \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c , the criteria by which a state may engage in war .\nIn the bluntest condemnation yet of the Trump Administration \u2019 s killing of Iran \u2019 s leading military commander , Dr Callamard argues that \u201c the targeted killing of General Soleimani , coming in the wake of 20 years of distortions of international law , and repeated massive violations of humanitarian law , is not just a slippery slope .\nIt is a cliff.\n\u201d She also warns that the killing of Iran \u2019 s top general may see other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the assassination : \u201c The international community must now confront the very real prospect that States may opt to \u2018 strategically \u2019 eliminate high ranking military officials outside the context of a \u2018 known \u2019 war , and seek to justify the killing on the grounds of the target \u2019 s classification as a \u2018 terrorist \u2019 who posed a potential future threat.\n\u201d Speaking to Airwars from Geneva ahead of her presentation to the UNHRC , Dr Callamard described the US killing of General Soleimani as \u201c a significant escalation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of extraterritorial force .\nUntil now , drones have focused on terrorism and on counterterrorism responses .\nHere we \u2019 re seeing the displacement of a counterterrorism strategy onto State officials.\n\u201d She described the Trump administration \u2019 s justification of the assassination of a senior Iranian government official as \u201c a distortion of self defence.\n\u201d Dr Callamard \u2019 s denouncement of the US \u2019 s killing of Qasem Soleimani marks the latest in almost 20 years of concerns raised by United Nations experts on the use of armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the killing of five al Qaeda suspects in Yemen by the CIA , then-rapporteur Asma Jahangir warned for example that the attack constituted \u201c a clear case of extrajudicial killing \u201d .\nUN reports since then have tended to focus on controversial drone campaigns outside the hot battlefield , in countries including Pakistan , Yemen , Somalia and Palestine \u2019 s West Bank and Gaza Strip .\nWith her new report , delivered to the UNHRC on July 9th , Dr Callamard seeks to bring the discussion on armed drone use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world has entered what has been called the \u2018 second drone age \u2019 with a now vast array of State and non-State actors deploying ever more advanced drone technologies , making their use a major and fast becoming international security issue.\n\u201d The term \u2018 second drone age \u2019 was originally coined by Airwars director Chris Woods , to reflect a growing wave of armed drone proliferation among state and non-state actors .\nAs Dr Callamard and her team write : \u201c The present report seeks to update previous findings .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the legal implications of their promises ; questions the legal bases upon which their use is founded and legitimized ; and identifies the mechanisms and institutions ( or lack thereof ) to regulate drones \u2019 use and respond to targeted killings .\nThe report shows that drones are a lightning rod for key questions about protection of the right to life in conflicts , asymmetrical warfare , counter-terrorism operations , and so-called peace situations.\n\u201d Many of the conflicts monitored by Airwars are referenced by Dr Callamard .\n\u2022 In Iraq , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISIS deployed armed drones , sometimes to devastating effect .\n\u201c In 2017 in Mosul , Iraq , for example , within a 24-hour period \u2018 there were no less than 82 drones of all shapes and sizes \u2019 striking at Iraqi , Kurdish , US , and French forces.\n\u201d \u2022 In Libya , the Special Rapporteur asserts that \u201c The Haftar Armed Forces carried out over 600 drone strikes against opposition targets resulting allegedly in massive civilian casualties , including , in August 2019 , against a migrant detention center.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling or unable to act \u2019 defence \u2013 first used by George W Bush \u2019 s administration to justify drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere \u2013 had been employed by several nations , including Turkey and Israel , to justify attacks in Syria .\n\u2022 The UN Special Rapporteur also cautions that as more States acquire armed drones , their use domestically has increased : \u201c Turkey has reportedly used drones domestically against the Kurdistan Worker \u2019 s Party ( PKK ) , while Nigeria first confirmed attack was carried out against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2015 Pakistan allegedly used its armed drones for the very first time in an operation to kill three \u2018 high profile terrorists.\n\u2019 Iraq has similarly purchased drones to carry out strikes against ISIS in Anbar province in 2016.\n\u201d \u2022 Finally , Dr Callamard warns that non-State actors including terrorist groups increasingly have access to remotely piloted technologies \u2013 noting that \u201c At least 20 armed non-State actors have reportedly obtained armed and unarmed drone systems.\n\u201d \u201c Drones are now the weapon of choice for many countries .\nThey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save lives \u2013 though we have insufficient evidence to conclude either , \u201d Dr Callamard told Airwars .\n\u201c Drones may save the lives of \u2018 our \u2019 soldiers \u2013 but on the ground is another matter.\n\u201d The UN Special Rapporteur \u2019 s latest report highlights concerns about ongoing risks to civilians from armed drone use .\nCiting multiple studies , she writes that \u201c even when a drone ( eventually ) strikes its intended target , accurately and \u2018 successfully \u2019 , the evidence shows that frequently many more people die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callamard also cautions that \u201c Civilian harm caused by armed drone strikes extends far beyond killings , with many more wounded .\nWhile the consequences of both armed and non-combat drones remain to be systematically studied , evidence shows that the populations living under \u2018 drones \u2019 persistent stare and noise experience generalized threat and daily terror \u2019 .\n\u201d The UN \u2019 s expert on extrajudicial killings additionally notes the key role drones play in helping militaries to determine likely civilian harm : \u201c Without on-the-ground , post-strike assessment , authorities rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect civilian casualties leaving potentially significant numbers of civilian casualties , including of those misidentified as \u2018 enemies \u2019 , undiscovered .\nStudies showed that in Syria and Iraq the initial military estimates missed 57 % of casualties.\n\u201d The Special Rapporteur does however point out that civilian harm can be reduced by militaries , \u201c through stronger coordination , improved data analysis , better training of drones \u2019 operators , and systematic evaluation of strikes .\n\u201d", "author": "Chris Woods", "url":

evening of August 7th 2014 , then-US President Barack Obama gave a live address to the nation announcing the beginning of military actions in Iraq against so-called Islamic State ( also known as ISIS and Daesh ) , ushering in a new era of US involvement .\nThe following day , US Navy F-18 Hornet fighters launched the first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq .\nSix years on , and 14,700 international air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more by Iraq government forces , Iraqis are still reeling from the war against ISIS and its aftermath .\nThe conflict itself displaced over five million Iraqis and left schools , hospitals and other vital infrastructure in affected provinces across northern and central Iraq in utter ruin .\nWhile statistics on the number of civilians who perished overall during the war against

and the aftermath of the military campaign .\nThey also speak to the ongoing challenges that Iraqis living in formerly ISIS-occupied areas continue to face six years on .\nBy the time the US began its

plunging the nation into its most serious crisis since the US-British invasion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air campaign came shortly after ISIS \u2019 s genocidal campaign on the Yazidi community in Sinjar and

Speicher .\nThe next three years would see the lives of millions of people change radically .\nThe terror group \u2019 s occupation of these territories ravaged communities and decimated the social fabric of many of the cities under the group \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ISIS occupation recount wanton acts of brutality by the group , in a bid to enforce their control and dominance .\nKhalid al-Rawi , a musician and community activist in Mosul [ see main picture ] , describes the state of fear instilled by the group during their occupation of Iraq \u2019 s second city .\n\u201c I know many musicians who destroyed their instruments [ out of fear of being caught ] or would go far away in order to play a bit of music\u2026 If anyone played music openly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians wouldn \u2019 t have dared to do this \u201d , Khalid recalled to Airwars this week .\n\u201c People were killed for the smallest reasons by them [ ISIS ] \u2013 I was one of the people who if they caught me , I would have been killed instantly.\n\u201d Ziad Ghanim Sha \u2019 ban , a lawyer from Tikrit in Salahuddin province , paints a similar picture of violence and fear under ISIS , particularly when it came to religious and ethnic coexistence .\n\u201c Iraqi society , as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ethnic and religious groups ] , \u201d explains Ziad .\n\u201c We have Kurds , we have Sunnis

killed anyone promoting this [ coexistence ] \u2013 this instilled great fear in society and many families were torn from the community.\n\u201d Ziad goes on to recall how some husbands and wives who had spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is predominantly Shia Muslim \u2013 divorced and ran away to avoid persecution by the group .\nWar on ISIS and the legacy of the International Coalition Following a series of gains made by ISIS throughout 2014 that saw the terror group control up to a fifth of Iraq \u2019 s territory and 6.3 million people ( 19 % of the population ) , the Iraqi Government , with the support of the Popular Mobilisation Units ( PMUs ) consisting of numerous armed groups , as well as international allies led by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly reclaiming territory until the group \u2019 s territorial defeat in December 2017 .\nThe role played by the US-led Coalition was instrumental in eventually defeating ISIS .\nThe US-led alliance has declared 14,771 air and artillery strikes in Iraq since its inception , providing air cover for Iraqi Security Forces ( ISF ) and decimating ISIS positions in northern and western Iraq .\nToday the group exists only on the margins of

civilians during its occupation , and many more died in ISF actions .\nUsing local sources , Airwars has also to date tracked 895 separate civilian harm allegations against the International Coalition

admitted 688 deaths from its actions in Iraq .\nBeyond this , the military campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ruins , making it almost impossible for hundreds of thousands of civilians \u2013 still displaced by the conflict \u2013 to return to their homes .\nKhalid recalls a number of instances where families were caught up in airstrikes targeting ISIS militants : \u201c I have a friend whose family , including uncles and aunts , were living in the same house .\nFrom what was explained to me , there was one ISIS member on the roof of the house so an International Coalition missile struck the building , killing 13 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recounts the tragic story of his younger brother , who was killed by what he says was an International Coalition airstrike in Tikrit .\n\u201c I have my brother , a child , named Muhanad aged only 11 years old , who was injured in an airstrike and died immediately and we have still , to this day , not received any compensation or acknowledgement from the Coalition.\n\u201d In almost all cases , those interviewed say that very few , if anyone , receives any form of acknowledgement or compensation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition .\n\u201c The reality is that as a lawyer , as part of a team of lawyers , we submitted more than a hundred complaints against Coalition forces , calling for compensation\u2026In the end we didn \u2019 t even receive 5 % of the compensation we were entitled to , \u201d Ziad told Airwars .\nSix years on from the beginning of the International Coalition \u2019 s own campaign against ISIS , the societal impact of the

re-emergence of a vibrant civil society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet significant silver lining in the post-ISIS years .\n\u201c A number of initiatives have emerged aimed at promoting reconciliation , which I

of young people helped clean another church in Mosul.\n\u201d He also says that the city \u2019 s experience under ISIS rule has changed many people \u2019 s attitudes about music and the arts @ @ @ @

civic revival , many in Tikrit are afraid to engage in civic activities , he says .\n\u201c Since the violence we saw in Hawijah and Tikrit in 2013 against protesters and by ISIS during their rule , activists have not emerged in our areas because they saw the executions that would take place if they did come out\u2026 Even when protests emerged in Baghdad and the south [ in 2019 and 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salahuddin , Anbar , Hawijah and Mosul because [ people ] knew they could be killed , \u201d explains Ziad .\nIn terms of reconstruction , efforts by the Government have often seemed futile , with progress slow and , in many cases , non-existent .\nDespite liberation from ISIS , residents of Anbar , Salahuddin and Nineveh provinces face an uphill task in rebuilding their cities and communities , made even more difficult by government incompetence and widespread corruption .\nAbdulrahman Mohammad , a businessman and community leader in Fallujah , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISIS back in 2014 , explains that upon returning to his city after three years , he found a city in ruins and a devastated local economy .\n\u201c When we came back after ISIS , everything we had was lost .\nOur

of geolocation , research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships with key US and international media on the most vital and controversial cases and stories .\nIn doing so , it aims to bridge a critical gap in the mainstream reporting of civilian harm from war \u2013 and bring many more stories to public awareness .\nA key focus will be to explore innovative approaches to engaging new audiences on civilian harm issues .\nSince its founding , Airwars has published several major investigations into civilian harm .\nIn 2017 our then-inhouse reporter Samuel Oakford revealed with Foreign Policy that , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 80 civilians had been killed in non-US international airstrikes in Iraq and Syria .\nThat investigation still serves as a key point of engagement for our advocacy work with individual belligerents .\nIn June 2019 , Airwars partnered with Amnesty International on a major project War in Raqqa : Rhetoric versus Reality \u2013 which found that at least 1,600 civilian deaths had likely been caused by the US-led Coalition during the battle of Raqqa .\nMore recently , Airwars has played a prominent role in reporting the scandal surrounding Dutch responsibility for @

brutal siege of Libya \u2019 s capital ended , new interactive Airwars mapping shows the impact of 14 months of fighting between two rival governments on the city \u2019 s beleaguered civilians .\nAirwars has visualised every allegation of civilian harm from air and artillery strikes during the period of war in and around Tripoli between April 2019 and June 2020 .\nGlasgow-based consultants Rectangle designed the innovative mapping , in an effort to find fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern battlefield .\nThe new Airwars mapping uses a sliding timeline to enable an overview of often indiscriminate air and artillery strikes on Tripoli and its suburbs .\nA fine-detail satellite map of Tripoli and its suburbs makes it possible to see the siege evolving over the 14 months of its duration .\nThe map utilises a 1km radius hexagonal system , whose height represents the number of civilians reported killed in an incident .\nThis in turn enables users to see the extent of shelling on various neighbourhoods , with casualty spikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Salaheddin , Abu Salim and Tajoura .\nThe new mapping can also be used as a portal to access individual civilian harm assessments on the Airwars website .\nLizzie Malcolm and Daniel Powers of design consultancy Rectangle explain their rationale behind the new approach : \u201c The challenge of mapping and visualising civilian harm is to balance the presentation of aggregated information and individual details .\nMaps of large areas and timelines of conflicts are useful for understanding scale .\nBut any visualisation should be a gateway to the evidence and stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Airwars .\nOver the course of the siege , Airwars recorded 339 civilian harm events in Libya , 197 of which around Tripoli , nearly tripling the number of locally reported incidents since the end of the NATO campaign in 2011 .\nAt least 197 civilians were killed by the violence and another 537 were injured by the violence , as the LNA and GNA fought for control of Tripoli .\nThe LNA \u2019 s Tripoli offensive introduced Libyans to a degree of conflict violence not seen since NATO \u2019 s intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict was over , LNA forces and Wagner mercenaries reportedly booby-trapped houses and planted landmines , leading to gruesome additional reports of killed and injured civilians .\nThe siege of Tripoli has previously been visualised by other organisations , though not via an interactive map .\nUN agency OCHA has for example provided infographics summing up their findings .\nAnd Dzsihad Hadelli has previously visualised Airwars data on civilian casualties for the Libya Observer .\nMapping and recording harm in conflicts can help both with the proper investigation of civilian casualties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to reconciliation and justice in those parts of society affected by the fighting .\n\u201c There is no way out of this without people being held accountable , \u201c says Elham Saudi , Director of Lawyers for Justice in Libya .\nHer organisation seeks to document violations of humanitarian and human rights law in Libya , in turn hoping for accountability .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re aiming for criminal responsibility , the threshold is really high .\nFirst hand accounts and witnesses are the most important thing , \u201c Saudi explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to an event in question is another crucial point , she adds .\nAs a former resident of Tripoli suburbs , Saudi knows from friends and family what the siege did to Tripoli \u2019 s population : \u201c The impact was felt throughout the city , the fear and anticipation of being targeted was quite overwhelming \u2013 even if you didn \u2019 t live in the areas being targeted , because of the indiscriminate nature of the attacks .\nYou always felt like you were a target.\n\u201d However , her organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Tripoli but investigates violations committed in the civil war across the country .\nThe highly polarised political landscape poses an additional challenge , as activists and media in Libya are often affiliated with one of the parties to the conflict : \u201c The hyper-politicisation of everything makes it very difficult to keep the distance from what \u2019 s being said in the media .\nI don \u2019 t disregard anything just because it belongs to a certain party.\n\u201d \u201c Things get lost if you don \u2019 t preserve evidence in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s not just about the present but also about the future for civil society , \u201c the lawyer elaborates .\nSocial media plays an increasing role there as \u201c Perpetrators help you because they incriminate themselves.\n\u201c Mahmoud Werfalli \u2019 s arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court , for example , was based on social media accounts of extrajudicial killings .\nThe former LNA commander is accused of executing ten prisoners in Benghazi in 2018 , a case that was widely documented on social networks \u2013 as are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt this point it remains difficult to predict which alleged incidents might potentially bear fruit in court .\nWar crimes were alleged on both sides of the conflict .\n\u201c The US is promising because Haftar , as a US citizen , is subject to its jurisdiction ; it also allows for individuals to pursue civil responsibility , \u201d Saudi says .\nThree civil lawsuits attempting to do that have been filed in the US for example , whereby affected families are suing the General for compensation for his alleged responsibility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the indiscriminate shelling of Tripoli neighbourhoods by his forces .\nEven as the search for accountability continues , rifts remain deep within Libyan society after so many years of civil war .\nThe big question is : how might Libya finally find a way towards a peaceful future ?\nA pause in fighting between Libya \u2019 s rival camps might be expected to generate optimism in a country riven by intermittent civil war since 2011 .\nBut instead of improving the livelihoods of the population , both seem keen to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the siege of Tripoli in the first place .\nInfighting within both the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) and the Libyan National Army ( LNA ) ; profound economic problems ; and deep distrust between all the main political actors , make a peaceful future more uncertain .\nRecently popular protests erupted in both GNA- and LNA-controlled territories , that were in turn met with violence by both governments .\nAt the same time , a new military build-up around Sirte has raised fears of another escalation in violence \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the population into ever deeper poverty .\nVirginie Collombier , Professor of Social and Political Dynamics in Libya at the European University Institute of Florence , has been working on grassroots mediation processes led by Libyans for many years .\nShe sees the first step to a lasting ceasefire taking place at the international level \u2013 getting countries now meddling in Libya to respect the commitments they made during the Berlin peace conference : \u201c The aim of the mediation process is to find someone who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe UN can \u2019 t do anything alone as we see ; and the EU doesn \u2019 t have the capacities or willingness.\n\u201c \u201c Who has the capacities to influence things on the ground : Russia ?\nTurkey ?\n\u201c Collombier asks .\nNeither seems a likely candidate given the ongoing geopolitical struggle between these two states : \u201c Most importantly [ there is ] the US , but will they work as a guarantor on broader issues related to the economy , and the political framework ?\n\u201c The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Collombier believes : \u201c There is clearly a sense of exhaustion , the meaning of the war is lost , which is something we can see on both sides of the divide.\n\u201c She adds : \u201c There is not much we can achieve through violence and weapons , the situation has stabilised around two camps that can block each other.\n\u201c However , internal divisions in both the GNA and in Haftar \u2019 s camp show that the situation could turn violent again if issues are not resolved .\nCollombier stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Libyans , beyond the GNA and LNA : \u201c Voices of Libyans can be heard and put pressure on politics ; and diversifying the political sphere is absolutely crucial .\nThere is a need for alternative voices and leaders .\nThere is deep distrust in the current political elite.\n\u201d Whatever the result of both reconciliation and accountability processes in Libya , there is a long way ahead for the country to finally find peace .\nDocumenting and archiving the crimes committed during the civil war is only an initial step towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between former enemies .", "author": "Oliver Imhof", "url":

in the Coalition , refusing publicly to concede any civilian harm from its own actions and with no additional accountability mechanisms being put in place during the new deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament.. Airwars , together with our Belgian and international partners , is today publishing a joint open letter recently sent to Minister of Defence Philippe Goffin , which urges the Belgian government to take concrete steps to improve its transparency and accountability for civilian harm resulting from its own military actions .\nThe full text is reprinted below .\nOn October 1st , 2020 , Belgium will send four F-16s to participate in Operation Inherent Resolve .\nAs a collective of civil society organisations , we have concerns about the limited levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBelgium \u2019 s past participation in Operation Inherent Resolve still remains highly secretive .\nAs a result , Belgian members of Parliament can not thoroughly exercise democratic oversight , while the Belgian , Syrian and Iraqi public are kept in the dark about possible cases of civilian harm as the result of previous Belgian airstrikes or other activities in support of airstrikes in the fight against the so-called Islamic State .\nPrevious comparative research by Airwars has highlighted that Belgium remains one of the least transparent countries in the US-led International Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BBC , De Morgen and Liberation revealed in March 2020 , Belgium refuses to acknowledge civilian casualties from its actions , even where the US-led Coalition has conceded these same cases as credible .\nIn response to this investigation , the Belgian Ministry of Defence stated only that the Belgium Armed Forces ( BAF ) were \u201c certainly not involved in all events \u201d , without providing any more details or proof for such a bold claim .\nBelgium \u2019 s focus thus far in the debate on civilian harm and accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs long as the Belgian Ministry of Defence does not consider civilian harm incidents to have breached international humanitarian law , it refrains from engaging in exercises or lessons learnt , or in evaluations that are publicly available .\nWe believe that this position is not sustainable .\nAs we have seen in the Netherlands , where media uncovered in October 2019 that the Netherlands had been responsible for a 2015 airstrike on Hawijah , Iraq , in which at least 70 civilians died , once the truth about civilian harm incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to major national blowback and severely harm the trust of both Parliament and the public in its government .\nSo far , the Belgium Ministry of Defence has given few signs that it is committed to improving its transparency and accountability practices during the coming deployment of four F-16s , even while there has been a clear message from Parliament that more transparency is required .\nWe , therefore , urge the Ministry of Defence to fully comply with a parliamentary resolution of June 25th , 2020 .\nSpecifically , Amendment number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion request the federal government to do the following ( unofficial translation ) : 4 .\nTo demonstrate militarily responsible maximum transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the Chamber of Representatives , with regard to the prevention , monitoring and reporting of possible civilian casualties as a result of our military efforts , in particular through strengthening parliamentary scrutiny of the actions of the national Red Card Holder .\n6 .\nTo actively consult with the Dutch government in order to take note of all the lessons learned from the Hawija tragedy , to understand them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives on how these lessons will be used during the Belgian military deployment , in order to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible .\n17 .\nTo communicate publicly , after investigation and taking into account military and security considerations , about possible civilian casualties as a result of Belgian military operations and to ensure active cooperation and exchange with external monitoring groups and human rights organizations ( emphasis added ) .\nCurrently , consultative processes are ongoing [ with militaries ] in the United States , the United Kingdom and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian harm and to implement policies to better protect civilians in armed conflict .\nThese processes are taking place in consultation with various civil society organisations , including academics and NGOs , such as Airwars , CIVIC , Amnesty International and local civil society organisations .\nWe believe that it is crucial that Belgium commits itself to improve its poor transparency and accountability track record .\nWe hereby wish to inform you that we , as a collective of civil society organisations , stand ready to actively work together and share our expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make concrete progress towards improved transparency and accountability of Belgium \u2019 s upcoming military deployment in Iraq and Syria .\nThe undersigned organisations call upon the Belgian government to , at the minimum : \u2022 Publish the exact date and near location of all Belgian air raids carried out in the fight against ISIS ; \u2022 Publish the results of all investigations into civilian casualties \u2013 including the data , location , targets and number of civilian casualties of military action \u2013 even if the Ministry of Defence \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no violation of international humanitarian law ; \u2022 Draft guidelines for proactively publishing this information ( in the future ) as open data in a machine-readable overview that enables control by independent parties ; \u2022 To work together with external parties , including NGOs , by drawing up standards for the minimum criteria that external claims for civilian victims must meet in order for the Ministry of Defence to be able to assess them ; \u2022 Provide capacity at the Ministry of Defence so that officials can focus on monitoring and actively publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed conflict , including in future military interventions so that the consequences of military intervention are systematically monitored and published ; \u2022 Introduce or support a mechanism where potential victims of Coalition bombardments can come forward and report issues of concern ; \u2022 Adopt a political declaration on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas with a clear commitment to data collection and transparent reporting .\nWhile the Belgian military has decided to use precise small diameter bombs during the coming deployment period , we believe that it is crucial to emphasise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian infrastructure , in particular in urban areas , requires more than using precision weapons .\nThe undersigned organisations are preparing to publicly communicate on this matter and share a copy of this letter with the Belgian press by the end of September , as we believe this discussion concerns the Belgian public .\nWe hope that you will respond positively to our call for cooperation and exchange on this important matter , and we are happy to enter into dialogue with the Ministry of

Secretary of State responded : \u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the price\u2013we think the price is worth it.\n\u201d Airwars data collected from local sources indicates that since 2014 , at least 15,000 civilians were likely killed as a result of airstrikes and shelling from at least 17 foreign powers fighting within Syria , including members of the US-led Coalition ; Russia ; Iran ; Turkey ; and Israel .\nThousands more have been injured .\nHere the Airwars Syria team asks : has the price paid by civilians been worth it ?\nFor some Syrians , the intervention of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins in the Assad government \u2019 s mishandling of mass demonstrations in the early days of a national uprising .\nJala , a Syrian woman now living in London , told Airwars \u201c Had the crisis been managed correctly by the Syrian regime back in 2011 , and had the regime focused on a political solution and refrained from using power against its own people and from deploying the army in Dara \u2019 a , the intervening powers wouldn \u2019 t have found a pretext , and we wouldn \u2019 t be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervention of so many foreign powers in Syria vary widely .\nFor Russia , assistance to the Assad government has helped deliver long dreamt of access to a Mediterranean port .\nFor Iran , its costly efforts to ensure the survival of the Syrian regime while seeking to promote a regional anti-Israel axis have been paramount .\nFor the United States and its Coalition allies , a desire to defeat the terrorist group Islamic State has more recently been supplemented by a desire to counter Iranian and Russian plans for Syria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos of Syria \u2019 s wars to impose a buffer zone in northern Syria and disrupt Kurdish efforts to carve out a new state .\nAnd Israel , although not involved in the ground conflict , has nevertheless conducted hundreds of airstrikes against both Iranian and Hezbollah forces within Syria in recent years .\nWith so many foreign powers and their proxy actors fighting within Syria , this chart by analyst Charles Lister from 2016 indicates the sheer complexity of the situation .\nWithout the intervention of so many foreign powers in Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have looked very different .\nStarved of Russian and Iranian support , the Assad government would most likely have been overrun by rebel forces .\nISIS would also likely have surged , using the vast arsenal of weapons it had captured in Iraq during 2014 to occupy more and more Syrian territory .\nSo did the international intervention save the Syrian peoples ?\nOr instead has it elongated and exacerbated the conflict , and consequently the suffering of civilians ?\nFollowing an earlier military intervention in Syria by Iran in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week the US-led Coalition launched its first airstrikes in Syria on September 23rd 2014 , targeting both the so-called Islamic State that now controlled vast swathes of Syria ; and also al-Qaeda \u2019 s local Syrian faction .\nDozens of strikes by US , Saudi , Emirati and Jordanian aircraft that day \u2013 as well as Tomahawk missiles fired from US warships \u2013 led to the Coalition \u2019 s first reported massacre of civilians in Syria in Kafar Dryan .\nThe Coalition still denies civilian casualties in that attack .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground since 2014 , the long running Coalition campaign against ISIS in Syria has so far likely killed at least 5,658 civilians , a high proportion of whom were women and children .\nAlmost four thousand more civilians have reportedly been injured .\nThe alliance itself presently concedes 671 non combatants killed by its actions .\nHasan Al-Kassab is an activist from Raqqa , who worked in the research unit of the Euphrates Project which funds many reconstruction and body retrieval projects in Raqqa .\nHasan told Airwars that he lost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Raqqa campaign in 2017 .\nOne uncle , Abdul Latif Hasan Al-kassab , was taking water from the Euphrates river when a Coalition airstrike targeted the area on June 25th 2017 .\nHis uncle was immediately killed along with two other civilians .\nHis other uncle died when another Coalition airstrike targeted a building in Raqqa days before the city was liberated .\n\u201c There is no mechanism to contact the Coalition who I believe is responsible for the death of my two uncles to investigate their death , \u201d says Hasan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Initial Response Team in Raqqa has so far found 28 mass graves in Raqqa , containing more than 6,000 bodies , with two thirds of them believed to be civilians .\nZain Al-Abidin Al-A \u2019 kedi , an activist from Deir Ezzor living in northern Syria , told Airwars that he believes that the Coalition \u2019 s intervention against ISIS in Syria was necessary , but had come too late .\n\u201c The wasted time led to an increase in the number of deaths and casualties by ISIS and the US-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage in the cities and towns , \u201d Zain said .\nFiras Hanosh , an activist from Raqqa and a former doctor with Medecins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in one of Raqqa \u2019 s field hospitals , also believes that the US-led Coalition intervention in Syria was necessary , because local forces were unable to defeat ISIS .\nHowever , he argues that the Coalition \u2019 s choice of the mainly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces as its ground proxy was a mistake .\n\u201c The US-led Coalition didn \u2019 t choose the right partner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is racist against the Arab civilians.\n\u201d Firas told Airwars that it is unsafe for him to return to his ravaged home city .\nHe says he is also worried about being arrested by the SDF , because of his work as an activist monitoring the situation in Raqqa .\nWary of intervening on the ground in Syria or getting involved in the civil war , the US still needed to combat ISIS .\nIt therefore turned to the Kurds \u2013 initially helping the newly formed SDF to drive out ISIS from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s intervention forces , we would have lost Kobane , Qamishli and other Kurdish areas.\n\u201d Dlshad , a Syrian cyber security engineer now living in Washington DC , said .\nHowever , as the SDF then advanced against ISIS in primarily Arabic-population territory , tensions rose .\nOther Syrians believe the US and its allies had hidden motives .\nJala , a Syrian woman now living in London , believes that the US intervention in Syria , though declared to be against ISIS , was in fact aimed at controlling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump has done little to dispel this view , and US troops today occupy many of Syria \u2019 s oil fields .\nEven as the US-led Coalition was ramping up its attacks against ISIS in Syria , the regime was losing badly on the ground to rebel forces .\nReports estimated that despite Iranian and Hezbollah support , Bashar al-Assad held only 25 % of Syria by late 2015 .\nAssad asked for support from his Russian allies \u2013 leading to Moscow \u2019 s largest foreign intervention since its disastrous Afghanistan campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prove to be very different .\nThe first Russian airstrikes in Syria took place on September 30th 2015 , targeting the towns of Za ` faranah , Talbisah and Ar-Rastan in Homs ; and Al Makrmeya and Jisr al Shughour in Idlib .\nFrom the first day , the effects on civilians were devastating .\nAt least 43 civilians reportedly died in Russia \u2019 s initial airstrikes \u2013 with more than 150 more injured .\nAccused of indifference to civilian harm from its actions in Syria \u2013 and even the deliberate targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit to a single civilian death in five years of war .\nAirwars monitoring has so far recorded 4,487 locally reported problem airstrikes by Russia in partnership with the Assad government from 2015 to 2020 \u2013 which between them reportedly led to the deaths of as many as 22,000 non combatants , and the injuring of up to 40,000 more .\n\u201c The Russian intervention in Syria is not new , \u201d argues Dlshad , a cyber security engineer now living in Washington DC : \u201c I come from Rmeilan city which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in the city for a long time.\n\u201d That said , Dlshad believes the Russian intervention both extended the life of Bashar Al-Assad \u2019 s regime \u2013 and in some cases curbed his actions .\nHe argues for example that Assad would have been more brutal against his own people without Russian control .\n\u201c The Russian military involvement changed the military equation , \u201d argues Abdulkarim Ekzayez , a Research Associate at the Department of War Studies at King \u2019 s College , University of London and himself a Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure such as hospitals , schools and bakeries have weakened the resilience of the targeted communities in opposition held areas .\nConsequently the regime was able to take control over most of the opposition pockets in central and southern Syria , pushing all opposition factions into the north west with clearly defined contact lines between the two warring parties.\n\u201d Mohammed Al Fares , the nom de plume of a humanitarian worker living in Idlib , believes that the Russians have followed a systematic plan to target civilians in Syria \u2013 something the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .\nHowever , Jala believes that none of the actors in the Syrian conflict cared deeply about civilians , including Syrian fighters on the ground because they focused only on achieving military gains and not on civilians .\nThe other key ally of the Assad government , Iran , has taken a different approach .\nYears of sanctions have left it with a poorly equipped air force .\nInstead Tehran \u2019 s efforts in Syria focused on its domestic rocket and drone programmes , in turn channelling them to both Hezbollah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iranian ground forces have played a key role in the fighting .\nThe Quds Brigade is known to be involved at a senior level in the Syrian conflict and even in changing the structure of the Syrian army .\nThe Syrian 4th Brigade is close to Iran for example , while the 5th Brigade has closer links to Russian forces .\nWith a weak government in Damascus , multiple foreign powers have for years conducted unilateral actions in Syria in support of their own national interests .\nThe United States has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ; while the British conducted a controversial targeted killing of a UK citizen in 2015 .\nTwo nations in particular have fought lengthy unilateral campaigns .\nTurkey has launched several massive operations in North East Syria , alongside its earlier targeting of ISIS in Idlib .\nIn January 2018 , Ankara launched Operation Olive Branch in Afrin , and later Operation Peace Spring in October 2019 .\nOverall , hundreds of Syrian civilians have been locally reported killed by Turkish actions \u2013 both against Kurdish forces , and ISIS-occupied areas such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article were strongly opposed to Turkey \u2019 s interventions .\n\u201c There was no threat against Turkey .\nWhy did Turkey intervene ?\nTurkey is racist against the Kurds and that \u2019 s it , \u201d claimed Dlshad .\nH.J , a female architect from Damascus who asked not to be fully named for safety reasons , argued : \u201c Syrians thought that Erdogan was helping the Syrian cause , but he eventually used it as a bargaining chip with Europe ; causing destruction and division between Arabs and Kurds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel \u2019 s own unilateral aerial campaign in Syria has proved devastating against both Iranian and Hezbollah forces .\nIn early 2019 , a senior Israeli commander declared that the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) had dropped more than 2,000 bombs on Syria during the previous year , while Prime Minister Binyamin Netenyahu said that \u201c the IDF has attacked hundreds of times Iranian and Hezbollah targets.\n\u201d Despite the significant scale of Israel \u2019 s intervention , international attention has been limited .\nThis may in part be due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli strikes in Syria compared with other foreign powers .\nSince 2019 , Airwars monitoring indicates that between 13 and 22 civilians were killed and over 40 injured in nine Israeli airstrikes of concern .\nWith its focus in Syria almost exclusively on military targets , Israel appears to have limited the widescale civilian harm seen in the actions of others .\nAccording to Mohammed Al Fares , a Syrian spoken to for this article , \u201c It is good that Israel is destroying the regime \u2019 s military installations .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want Iran to get an upper hand in Syria , not for the sake of the Syrian people.\n\u201d Years of conflict in Syria , combined with external intervention by at least 17 foreign powers , have changed the face of the country for ever .\nAccording to the UNHCR , there are 6.2 million people , including 2.5 million children , currently internally displaced within Syria , the largest such population in the world .\nBeyond Syria \u2019 s borders , the total number of registered Syrian refugees has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links between external interventions and the displacement of civilians can be challenging to unpack .\nIn North East Syria for example actions by rebels ; by ISIS ; and later by Turkish forces , saw more than 215,000 people driven from their homes .\nWhile many have returned , an estimated 100,000 remain displaced .\nSimilarly , Syrian Arab Army operations supported from the air by Russia have proved highly disruptive .\nDuring the last major campaign between December 2019 and March 2020 in North West Syria , the UN reported a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including more than 575,000 children .\nHumanitarian worker Mohammed Al Fares , himself an IDP , told Airwars about his own experience .\n\u201c When you are forced outside your residence , you die slowly .\nYou lose everything , your home , your land , your job and your money .\nYou try to start over and build a new life , but it is difficult.\n\u201d The destruction of Syria \u2019 s infrastructure over the past nine years has also been extreme \u2013 much of it the result of foreign actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Aleppo and Raqqa \u2013 the first significantly at the hands of Russian forces ; the latter mostly as a result of the US-led Coalition \u2019 s targeting of ISIS .\nAccording to ReliefWeb : \u201c About a third of homes in Syria were thought to have been damaged or destroyed by 2017 .\nIn 2018 , the UN estimated the cost of material destruction in Syria at $ 120 billion.\n\u201d Hasan Al-Kassab told Airwars that eleven bridges in Raqqa were destroyed including Raqqa \u2019 s New Bridge during the Coalition \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only slowly starting to return because of a lack of basic services .\nFor example , 60 % of Raqqa is still without electricity .\nEast Aleppo , which witnessed brutal bombing by the Assad government supported by its Russian ally , experienced a similar fate .\nBattles which began in 2012 reached their climax in November 2016 , when SAA troops began a decisive campaign that ended a month later with the retaking of the city .\nThis caused very significant damage to Aleppo .\nH.J , the architect from Damascus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been systemic and not just \u2018 collateral damage \u2019 as militaries claim .\n\u201c The destruction caused by all different actors is called many things , of which : Urbicide/ Identicide .\nThat is , to commit a massacre against the urban environment ; to target relationships that connect people and places , erasing their identities .\nNowadays , one third of Syria is destroyed , and about 80 % of Syria \u2019 s Night lights are gone.\n\u201d Significant opposition remains from many countries to the reconstruction process in Syria while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US is implementing small scale rebuilding activities in areas under SDF control , focusing on basic services like water , electricity and rubble removal that don \u2019 t reach the level of reconstruction .\nAt the same time , with Russia and Iran unable significantly to support the regime financially as it seeks to rebuild Syria , limited scale investments risk lining the pockets of warlords , profiteers and cronies .\nMohammed Al Fares believes that overall , external intervention by so many foreign powers has had a negative impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the general situation in the country .\n\u201c Syrians had been in a state of solidarity with each other when the revolution started and [ they eventually ] controlled about 70 % of Syria .\nExternal intervention including money channelling , divided the Syrians and brought into the decision making people who were not fit to lead .\nThis in turn made the revolution very political until it lost its momentum .\nHowever , the revolution continues with its youth , women , elders and children despite all the obstacles it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccording to Hasan Al-Kassab from Raqqa : \u201c We can \u2019 t put all the interventions in the same basket .\nThe Coalition intervened to eliminate ISIS , Russia intervened to oppress the people and legitimise the regime against the civilians , while Turkey intervened to fight the PKK and secure its borders .\nHowever every intervention is still an occupation , because there is no mechanism to give oversight to the people .\nThey built military bases and disturbed the fabric of the Syrian people.\n\u201d From her side , H.J @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that after the regime started killing civilians in 2012 , the Syrian people tolerated even \u2018 allying with the devil \u2019 to oust Bashar Al-Assad .\n\u2018 \u2019 I didn \u2019 t personally support this opinion , but we needed any offerings , we naively thought that the world would help us without anything in return .\nWe were wrong , and all interventions were bad .\nThe country was divided , and military bases were established.\n\u201d With peace still nowhere in sight in Syria \u2013 and fighting likely to resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little sign of foreign powers withdrawing any time soon .\nWhile their interventions have radically changed conflict dynamics , they have done little to support the Syrian peoples in their aspirations for freedom and justice .\nYet if the same kind of resource spent by foreign powers on bombs and missiles could one day be diverted to Syria \u2019 s infrastructure development , to education , and to the fostering of civil society , another future remains possible .", "author": "Chris Woods", "url":

Belgium once again sent its F-16s to participate in Operation Inherent Resolve , fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria .\nYet the Belgian , Iraqi and Syrian publics are still kept in the dark when it comes to civilian harm during previous deployments .\nThe Belgian military to this day refuses to take responsibility for civilians its actions might have killed or injured .\nAlso this week , an open letter to defence minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Airwars \u2013 calling for greater transparency and accountability for reported civilian harm \u2013 has been widely covered by the Belgian media .\nUntil the end of 2017 , Belgium was one of the more active Coalition allies , alternating with the Dutch military .\nDuring some 991 declared missions , the Belgians fired nearly one thousand bombs and missiles .\nA total of 95 Belgian military personnel and a team of four Red Card Holders will now be deployed again until September 2021 .\nAccording to the parliamentary resolution approving this latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria \u201c covers only a buffer zone on the border with Iraq and is much more restricted than in 2017 \u201d .\nThe stated aim of the mission is to protect troops on the ground , and to carry out planned or ad-hoc targeted attacks on ISIS .\nIn August , the Belgian news organisation HLN reported that the Belgian military had updated its weapons to \u2018 precision bombs \u2019 .\nF-16s will be armed with bombs of the type GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb .\nAccording to a Belgian military technician , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical precision \u201d .\nAccording to Alma Al Osta , Arms Advocacy Manager with Humanity And Inclusion , this change of munition is not enough : \u201c There is much more to protecting civilians than just choosing a precise weapon .\nBelgium has indeed chosen GBU-39/B bombs , which are known for their precision , but these bombs weigh around 115kg and are capable of penetrating one meter of steel-reinforced concrete .\nIf this weapon is used on open battlefields without the presence of civilians , then the risk would be smaller .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities where people live , children go to school , and civilians gather on markets.\n\u201d Besides the direct impact of explosive weapons in urban areas , Al Osta is worried about their secondary effects : \u201c We have no information on how Belgium will prevent civilian harm and mitigate the so-called domino effects of airstrikes , such as trauma , damage to civilian objects , displacement , lack of access to education , health care and agricultural land , contamination with unexploded ordnances , damage to the environment and further instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , Commander of the Belgian Air Component Frederik Vansina refused to answer any questions on Belgian involvement in specific civilian harm incidents and told De Morgen : \u201c Countries within the Coalition show solidarity and neither confirm nor deny [ involvement ] .\nLet \u2019 s talk about how the Syrian regime and Russia operate there .\nThat \u2019 s a different story .\nJust look at the images of Homs and Aleppo.\n\u201d Back in 2017 , a senior Belgian official had told Airwars that the government was planning to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Qaim on February 27th 2017 and the second incident on March 21st of that year in the vicinity of Mosul .\nAccording to the US-led Coalition itself , the strikes had killed at least two civilians and injured four others .\nHowever , the Belgian government then publicly failed to take responsibility for these incidents , and even asserted that its actions had killed zero civilians .\nIn March 2020 , a joint investigation by Airwars , RTL Netherlands , BBC , De Morgen and Liberation revealed that Belgium consistently refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even where the US-led Coalition has conceded particular Belgian strikes to have killed and injured non combatants .\nIn response to this investigation , the Belgian Ministry of Defence stated only that the Belgium Armed Forces ( BAF ) were \u201c certainly not involved in all events.\n\u201d Previous comments by Colonel J. Poesen , head of operations at the Belgian Air Force , indicated that only incidents in which international humanitarian law was possibly violated were being investigated .\nHowever , the acknowledged civilian harm events recognised by the Coalition show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even where they might comply with international humanitarian law .\nA major bottleneck to greater transparency and accountability for Belgian military actions abroad is a lack of effective parliamentary oversight .\nAccording to a 2018 report by Pax Christi Vlaanderen and Vredesactie , \u201c there is no binding parliamentary approval for foreign missions , nor mandatory evaluations during and after the operation .\nMoreover , there is no formal and transparent framework under which the government periodically informs parliament about the specific objectives , content and consequences of military operations.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missions , established in the early 2000s , MPs are confidentially briefed about military interventions .\nYf Reykers , Assistant Professor in International Relations at Maastricht University notes : \u201c This commission is special in the sense that there are not many countries having such a commission in which high-level classified information is shared .\nHowever , that information can not be used by MPs who are part of that commission because they are bound to strict confidentiality .\nThey are also unable to verify this information independently with other sources.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does include several amendments that call on the government to improve its transparency and accountability practices .\nFor example , Parliament requests the federal government \u201c to communicate publicly , after investigation and taking into account military and security considerations , about possible civilian casualties as a result of Belgian military operations and to ensure active cooperation and exchange with external monitoring groups and human rights organizations.\n\u201d Reykers is generally positive about the amendments : \u201c It is progress that Parliament is even considering transparency and accountability practices .\nThat is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago .\nWe see that Belgium is learning from its neighbouring countries , such as the Netherlands , especially after the Hawijah scandal.\n\u201d However , Reykers also sees possibilities for the Government to manoeuvre itself through the amendments with minimum levels of transparency and accountability : \u201c The question is if these amendments will bring about structural change .\nOne of the things that is really needed is systematic evaluations [ of civilian harm claims ] before , during and after a mission , ideally publicly available.\n\u201d While the new parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its transparency and accountability during the upcoming deployment , it is yet to be seen whether Belgium will structurally change its practices \u2013 and whether the civilian victims of its previous airstrikes will receive answers .\n\u2022 This is an English-language version of an Opinion piece by Laurie Treffers for Airwars , published in the Belgian daily De

"source": "airwars", "title": "Libya\u2019s rival governments agree surprise ceasefire deal", "content": "Agreement could end civil war that has ravaged the country for almost a decade .\nBut questions remain over concrete implementation and foreign involvement .\nThe two most important parties to the conflict in Libya , the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) and the Libyan National Army ( LNA ) , agreed on October 23rd to an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations .\nThe landmark deal \u2013 which took many Libya analysts by surprise \u2013 could possibly cement the already peaceful situation of a de facto ceasefire in place since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces from Tripoli .\nBesides a freeze on all military agreements with foreign forces operating in Libya in general , the deal also implements various confidence-building measures such as the reopening of airports , seaports and roads between west and east Libya .\nAnother important feature agreed upon is the identification and categorization of all militias , with a view to reintegrating some of them into Libya \u2019 s armed forces .\nThe influence of militias , especially in and around Tripoli , has been a major factor in the destabilisation of post-Gaddafi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example to demobilise its powerful forces , which had been used as justification by the LNA in its recent failed attempt to seize the capital .\nThe UN-brokered ceasefire has been received positively by many commentators , in contrast with the outcome of the Berlin Conference in January 2019 , after which hostilities quickly flared up again due to the lack of any concrete mechanisms and guarantees .\nThis new agreement seems to be more robust , even though many details have yet to be figured out by the committees .\nAdditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past months has helped to put a political solution back on the table .\nActing Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Libya , Stephanie Williams , said in a statement : \u201c Today is a good day for the Libyan people.\n\u201d She added : \u201c The parties agreed that all military units and armed groups on the frontlines shall return to their camps .\nThis shall be accompanied by the departure of all mercenaries and foreign fighters from all Libyan territories \u2013 land , air and sea \u2013 within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today.\n\u201d International meddling had been one of the main drivers of the Libyan civil war .\nThe GNA had received extensive support from Turkey in the recent past , which also introduced Syrian mercenaries to the conflict who had previously fought for the Syrian National Army against the Assad regime .\nThe LNA in turn , supported by the United Arab Emirates , Russia and Egypt , has also allegedly made use of Syrian fighters as well as Sudanese mercenaries .\nThe United States had become increasingly vocal this year as Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air began playing an increasing role in Libya \u2019 s affairs .\nSome of those Russians are already said to have left the oil ports in both Sidra and Ras Lanuf .\nInternational arms shipments and the influx of mercenaries on both sides fuelled the conflict with devastating consequences for civilians .\nFrom the overall 777 minimum civilian deaths recorded by Airwars since the end of the NATO campaign in 2011 , 429 fatalities ( 55 per cent ) occurred after the beginning of the LNA \u2019 s offensive in April 2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of causing 271 deaths , 85 fatalities were attributed by local sources to the GNA and its ally Turkey .\nThe additional deaths could not clearly be attributed to any side .\nEnding international involvement in Libya will thus be crucial to finally putting an end to the civil war .\nHowever , it remains to be seen if all parties abide by the rules this time .\nPresident Erdogan of Turkey has already said that the agreement was \u201c not reliable \u201d as it was not made at the highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva , which included various parties to the conflict , with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas saying : \u201c The inner-Libyan discussion formats agreed at the Berlin Conference in January culminated in a first , decisive success .\nLibya has not yet reached its goal , but has cleared an important hurdle towards peace .\nIt is clear that the people in Libya want and must shape the future of their country themselves .\nWe therefore call on the international actors to support this path unreservedly and to refrain from any further interference .\n@", "author": "Oliver Imhof",

.\n\u201c Rather \u201d , write the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of an explosive weapon in relation to the proximity of civilians in populated areas.\n\u201d The PAX and Airwars report furthermore concludes that the cases of Mosul , Raqqah and Hawijah show that States acting in accordance with International Humanitarian Law is not enough in itself to prevent immense civilian harm and civilian suffering when explosive weapons are deployed in populated areas .\nCo-author of the report Roos Boer , programme leader of the Humanitarian Disarmament programme at Dutch peace organisation PAX , states : \u201c Large aircraft bombs and heavy artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing and shelling take place in towns and cities , civilians are killed and suffer life-changing injuries , and vital infrastructure like hospitals and schools are destroyed .\nWe need to see states agree to stronger rules that will stop these urban attacks.\n\u201d According to data monitoring by Action on Armed Violence ( AOAV ) , 92 per cent of the 19,401 civilian deaths and injuries tracked by the organisation from the worldwide use of explosive weapons in 2019 occurred in urban areas .\nFurthermore , AOAV concludes that when explosive weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles , rockets and aircraft bombs , are used in towns and cities , nine out of ten casualties are civilians .\nExplosive weapons are a major driver of forced displacement of civilians \u2013 not only because of fear of death and injury and the destruction of homes , but also because of their devastating impact on critical infrastructure services such as health care , education and water and sanitation services .\nTwo nations particularly affected by recent urban fighting are Iraq and Syria .\nWhile a variety of actors have caused major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , the report focuses on military operations by the US-led International Coalition against ISIS .\nUsing publicly available sources , the report analyses the short- and long-term effects of the use of explosive weapons in Mosul , Raqqa and Hawijah .\nThese cases illustrate that the effects of explosive weapons continue long after the bombs have exploded .\nIn Mosul , the costs of the 2016-17 campaign to drive ISIS out of the city were high : at least 9,000 civilians were reportedly killed in the fighting .\nAround 700,000 Moslawis were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 80 per cent of the inner city \u2019 s buildings were destroyed .\nIn June 2019 , the UN International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) reported that entire neighbourhoods of Mosul had yet to be rebuilt and that a lack of essential services and poor sanitation were still threatening public health .\nAdditionally , unexploded bombs , missiles , rockets and shells prevented civilians from returning to the city .\nSeeing Through The Rubble also adds fresh information on the current situation in Hawijah .\nSix different sources , including Hawijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report on the recent state of the city after a devastating 2015 Dutch airstrike on an ISIS IED factory , leading to the deaths of at least 70 civilians and hundreds more injured .\nThe report estimates that the secondary explosions triggered by the Dutch airstrike damaged between 400 and 500 buildings in the area , including many shops , homes and schools .\nSources also reported that the airstrike caused major damage to crucial infrastructure , including roads and water pipelines .\nAccording to the Mayor of Hawijah , Subhan Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildings have been rebuilt and much rubble remains .\nThe industrial area in Hawijah still suffers from a shortage of water and electricity .\nChris Woods , director of Airwars and a co-author of the report along with Laurie Treffers and Roos Boer , notes : \u201c In highlighting the negative consequences for civilians of recent Western military interventions at Mosul , Hawijah and Raqqa , our new report demonstrates why militaries can \u2019 t rely simply upon compliance with the laws of war when trying to reduce civilian casualties during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during city battles is a terrible reality \u2013 and greater international safeguards are urgently needed.\n\u201d Since 2019 , Ireland has been leading a series of consultations in Geneva , aimed at drawing up an international political declaration to ban the use of explosive weapons in urban areas .\nThe International Network on Explosive Weapons ( INEW ) , a network of NGOs , urges states to take immediate action to prevent human suffering from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas .\n\u201c These case studies show once again the unacceptably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of bombing and shelling in cities and other populated areas , \u201d says Laura Baillot , coordinator of INEW , responding to the new report .\n\u201c Every year we see tens of thousands of civilians killed and injured , that suffer psychological trauma , and are forced to flee for safety .\nCities are being torn apart \u2013 housing , hospitals , schools and vital infrastructure is destroyed which has disastrous consequences for the survival and wellbeing of the people that live there \u201d , continues Baillot .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered an inevitable consequence of war .\nUsing heavy explosive weapons such as heavy artillery , multi-barrel rocket launchers and large bombs and missiles in populated areas \u2013 even against military targets \u2013 is not acceptable and must stop .\n\u201d", "author": "Laurie Treffers", "url":

Airwars study shines light on opaque campaign", "content": "Despite at least 84 likely civilian deaths from US actions in Yemen under Donald Trump , public accountability peaked just 12 days into his presidency .\nA new Airwars investigation into the ongoing US counterterrorism campaign in Yemen has identified at least 86 civilians likely killed by US actions during Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency \u2013 though the US military has admitted to no more than a dozen deaths .\nEroding Transparency , researched and written by Mohammed al-Jumaily and Edward Ray , examines US air and ground actions against both Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , and Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than 230 declared and alleged US military and CIA actions are identified \u2013 among them 41 reported strikes in which Yemenis have alleged civilian casualties .\nAn accompanying public database details every alleged US action in Yemen since 2017 under President Trump .\nEmploying its highly-effective all source monitoring approach , Airwars has significantly reoriented research towards Yemeni voices and experiences .\nThere are some 4,400 unique sources in the new public database , sixty per cent of these in Arabic .\nMore than 140 alleged or confirmed US actions have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEroding Transparency shows that US operations in Yemen \u2013 already on the rise during the last two years of the Obama administration \u2013 significantly escalated under Trump , with dire consequences for civilian harm .\nUS operations too often lacked both the transparency and accountability standards of other recent US military interventions , and the report identifies a worrying emphasis under Trump of both clandestine and covert activity in Yemen , obscured from public scrutiny .\nAirwars \u2019 new research tracks a precipitous increase in alleged and confirmed US counterterrorism actions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year of the Trump presidency saw the highest reported US counterterrorism actions in Yemen since 2002 .\nThis escalation was accompanied by a significant loosening of restrictions on how the US military could operate in Yemen : \u201c It seems what happened was that the Trump administration was keen to take the gloves off , as it were , to be what they perceived was tougher on terrorism , and this was one of the first ready-made concepts of operation available , \u201d says Luke Hartig , previously Senior Director for Counterterrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama administration .\nWhen compared with available data on US actions during Barack Obama \u2019 s presidency ( 2009 \u2013 2017 ) , it is clear this initial spike under Trump in 2017 represented a distinct departure from the previous administration .\nThat one year saw a record 133 officially declared US airstrikes and ground actions in Yemen .\nTo put this in context , the total number of publicly declared actions in Yemen during the full presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama , over a 14 year period , amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Airwars research shows that US counterterrorism activity in Yemen has declined to its lowest reported levels since 2012 .\nThe expansion of US activity during the early Trump presidency resulted in a corresponding increase in likely civilian harm , Eroding Transparency reveals .\nOf the 86 minimum likely civilian deaths tracked by Airwars , some 93 per cent ( 80 deaths ) arose from reported US actions in Yemen between January 2017 and April 2018 .\nReported civilian deaths tracked by Airwars in 2017 significantly outstripped alleged deaths in any year during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism .\nThe estimated minimum civilian deaths from Trump strikes in Yemen include at least 28 children and 13 women , resulting from some 25 declared and likely US actions .\nAt least 63 likely civilian deaths resulted from twenty actions that US Central Command has itself publicly declared .\nEroding Transparency emphasises in particular the considerable risks of US ground actions to civilians ; alleged or confirmed US ground actions , though accounting only less than three per cent of likely US actions , were responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum confirmed or fair civilian harm tracked by Airwars .\nAirwars \u2019 new analysis further highlights the extent to which small Yemeni communities have borne the brunt of US counterterror actions .\nOne area of Bayda governorate , roughly 25km in radius , has been the site of almost a fifth of the total likely and declared US actions tracked by Airwars in the past four years \u2013 reportedly killing at least 38 civilians .\nYet these likely deaths have gone largely unrecognised by the US military .\nThe US Department of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a single action \u2013 the disastrous US special forces raid in Yakla , Bayda governorate , on January 29th 2017 .\nJust twelve days into the Trump presidency , the admission of civilian harm in that raid constituted the high watermark of accountability for the administration .\nYet even this concession was a considerable underestimate , In that same ground raid , Airwars and others assess that at least 20 civilians were in fact killed .\nThough President Trump removed civilian harm reporting requirements for the CIA , the Department of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its own actions annually to Congress .\nYet apart from the Yakla concession , the Pentagon has admitted to no further civilian deaths or injuries arising from US military actions in Yemen under Donald Trump .\nIn its 2018 and 2019 annual civilian casualty reports to Congress , the DoD instead asserted that it had found \u201c no credible reports of civilian casualties resulting from US military actions in Yemen \u201d for the years in question .\nDuring those same years , Airwars assesses , at least 30 civilian deaths were likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by local advocacy NGOs such as Mwatana for Human Rights .\nUS Central Command did not respond substantively to Airwars \u2019 comprehensive submission , nine weeks prior to the publication of Eroding Transparency , of more than 1,000 pages of archived source materials , in both English and Arabic , relating to all 41 declared and alleged US actions which had led to local claims of civilian harm in Yemen under President Trump .\nThroughout the US \u2019 s lengthy counterterrorism campaign in Yemen , the key focus has been an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence and influence in the country .\nThis began in earnest in 2009 , with the US taking the lead in containing AQAP as a result of what it saw as the Yemeni government \u2019 s inability to effectively counter terrorism in the country .\nSince the inauguration of President Trump , Airwars has tracked a minimum total of 460 militant deaths from alleged and confirmed US actions in Yemen \u2013 the overwhelming majority belonging to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) .\nA small cluster of strikes are also known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State in Yemen , in October and November 2017 .\nApproximately 60 % of the total minimum militant deaths tracked by Airwars , amounting to 242 AQAP or ISIS fighters , were killed in 2017 .\nAirwars research suggests a subtle focus by both CENTCOM and the CIA on targeting \u201c high-value \u201d targets , with the possible exception of the October 2017 attacks on ISIS-Y training camps , which appear to have been aimed at significantly degrading the group .\nAccording to Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall , the US \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put al-Qaeda under pressure because they end up being concerned about holding meetings to discuss strategy and iron out disputes\u2026 this means that the seeds of doubt and suspicion , both naturally occurring and sown by spies\u2026 and are left to fester and you end up with defections and splintering \u201d .\nAdditionally , while previously the group would have had programmes including \u201c educational training , military training , management training , \u201d the recent US campaign had made it almost impossible to run these programmes , says Dr Kendall .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also have thwarted local efforts to control and contain militant groups in Yemen .\nGiven the often porous relationship between AQAP and tribes , the sometimes indiscriminate nature ofsUS strikes has actively undermined efforts by tribal elders to convince their members who have joined AQAP to leave the group in exchange for immunity .\nAdditionally , deadly US ground raids in 2017 , in which dozens of civilians and tribal members were killed , have reportedly alienated local communities and further entrenched distrust and hostility towards US involvement in the country .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions may have had such unintended consequences .\nThe future of US actions in Yemen Though reported US actions have declined in frequency in the latter years of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency , there has also been a marked shift towards covert or clandestine US actions , shielded from public accountability .\nAs Eroding Transparency shows , while CENTCOM itself asserts that it has not conducted any airstrike in Yemen since June 24th 2019 , during that same period Airwars tracked 30 allegations of US strikes in Yemen .\nOf these 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airwars as likely US strikes based on local reporting .\nAnd in three events , all during 2020 , admission of responsibility for actions by US officials has in turn indicated those attacks were conducted either by the CIA , or were clandestine US military actions .\nAt this juncture , the future of US counter-terrorism in Yemen remains unclear .\nThough Airwars has monitored a clear decline in the apparent frequency of US actions since 2018 , Eroding Transparency also highlights a corresponding weakening of public accountability for those actions .", "author": "Chris Woods", "url":

Iraqis and Syrians to secure restitution and reconciliation The US-led Coalition has released to Airwars the near coordinates of almost all confirmed or \u2018 Credible \u2019 civilian harm events in Iraq and Syria in the long war against so-called Islamic State , allowing for the first time the accurate locating of 341 confirmed incidents and almost 1,400 civilian deaths since 2014 .\nThe groundbreaking decision by the US-led Coalition \u2013 which came after several years of patient engagement by Airwars \u2013 will enable affected Iraqis and Syrians for the first time to know whether their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular event .\nThat in turn could open the way for both apologies and ex gratia payments from the US and its international allies .\nFormer chief Coalition spokesman Colonel Myles Caggins said that the decision to share the data had been taken in the interest of transparency : \u201c We take every allegation of civilian casualties with the utmost sincerity , concern , and diligence ; we see the addition of the geolocations as a testament to transparency , and our commitment to working with agencies like Airwars to correctly identify civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this locational data for confirmed civilian harm events in Iraq and Syria \u2013 accurate in some cases to just one metre \u2013 sets a new and welcome transparency benchmark , \u201d Airwars noted .\n\u201c We appreciate the US-led Coalition \u2019 s decision to release this important material , which should help affected Iraqis and Syrians to secure some closure following tragic losses within their families.\n\u201d In August 2014 the US-led coalition began bombing so-called Islamic State after militants had seized large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq .\nMillions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lasted several years , with fighting often taking place in heavily built-up neighbourhoods .\nOver the years the US-led Coalition has admitted many hundreds of civilian deaths from its own actions \u2013 though identifying exactly where these took place has been a major challenge .\nThe release to Airwars of hundreds of coordinates of Credible incidents \u2013 most accurate to within 100 metres and some to within just one metre \u2013 is believed to be the most comprehensive locational civilian casualty data ever released by the US military .\nAirwars has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its website , The Credibles , which comprehensively maps all located incidents across both Iraq and Syria .\nThe data has also been visualised in partnership with The Washington Post .\nThe locational data provided by the US military is , Airwars believes , unique .\nNo previous belligerent is thought to have revealed at scale \u2013 either during or after a war \u2013 exactly where and when it has harmed civilians .\nUsing the US Department of Defense \u2019 s preferred Military Grid Reference System ( MGRS ) , 70 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been publicly geolocated by the Coalition to an accuracy of just one metre squared , with all additional events geolocated to an accuracy of a one hundred metre square box .\nMany of these incidents have already been well documented by affected communities themselves , with associated photographs , videos , and eyewitness narratives .\nAirwars also presently lists the names of more than 900 victims from these located events .\nJust three of 344 confirmed Coalition civilian casualty incidents have been omitted from the data release .\nOne recent case involved Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive Special Forces operations .\nAnother event is still being queried with US Central Command ( CENTCOM ) .\nThe third case is the sole British-confirmed anti ISIS event , from March 2018 \u2013 with the UK Ministry of Defence still declining to release any locational information .\nMore than 29,600 civilians have locally been alleged killed by US-led Coalition actions in Iraq and Syria since 2014 , according to Airwars monitoring of local populations .\nThe US was initially slow to engage \u2013 with just three civilian harm events confirmed by CENTCOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war .\nBeginning in 2016 , the process of casualty assessments by the US military became more systematised \u2013 in part as a result of an increased focus on casualty mitigation by the Obama administration during its last months in office ; and in part because of pressure from Airwars and other NGOs , which between them were tracking local allegations of civilian harm from Inherent Resolve actions in both Iraq and Syria .\nCENTCOM established a permanent civilian casualty assessment team at Tampa covering the war against ISIS in mid 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on confirmed civilian harm events .\nAn additional 60 Credible incidents were admitted that year , for example .\nIn December 2016 , the Coalition took over civilian casualty assessments from CENTCOM ( although almost all personnel continued to be drawn from US forces . )\nThe US-led alliance also began publishing monthly civilian harm assessments \u2013 which continue today .\nIn total , CENTCOM and the Coalition have now assessed almost 3,000 alleged civilian harm events in the war against ISIS , to date confirming as Credible some 344 of these incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties in Iraq and Syria by CENTCOM and the Coalition was generally well received , there were often significant challenges in properly identifying the location of such events .\nPress releases issued via military public affairs teams only tagged a Credible event to the nearest large population centre .\nIn the September 2017 report for example , the Coalition declared a major confirmed civilian harm event in Mosul : \u201c March 14 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq , via media report : During a strike on ISIS fighters engaging partner forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed that 27 civilians in an adjacent structure were unintentionally killed.\n\u201d The month of March 2017 saw very heavy fighting at Mosul .\nAirwars tracked five separate claimed civilian harm events in the city for March 14th alone ( two of them mass casualty incidents ) , with some days seeing more than a dozen allegations .\nWithout the correct coordinates , affected Moslawis could never know whether their loved ones were ( or were not ) affected by particular strikes .\nFor the March 14th 2017 event cited above , Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosul accurate to within just one metre ( 38SLF2901422174 ) , confirming that the event took place in the neighbourhood of al Jadida .\nThe challenge was whether such precise data could now be acquired for all confirmed events .\nSuch data could also help to prise open the door on possible restitution for civilian harm from US and Coalition actions in Iraq and Syria .\nAccording to the Pentagon , only six ex gratia payments were made to Iraqis during 2019 , compared with more than 600 such awards for Afghanistan .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolve for confirmed civilian harm events has majorly hampered the ability of Iraqis and Syrians to pursue claims \u2013 until now .\nFollowing a face to face meeting with senior officials in Tampa in May 2016 , CENTCOM and Airwars began regularly sharing data on civilian casualty allegations , in order to improve understanding , on both sides , of reported non combatant harm .\nThat relationship has continued , with sometimes weekly confidential engagements between the Coalition \u2019 s CIVCAS Cell and the Airwars military advocacy team , involving granular queries from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Airwars occasional precise locational data for Credible events in mid 2016 , in order better to clarify particular cases .\nOver time this became more systematised .\nAlongside its monthly public press releases , the Coalition for several years provided Airwars with a private , annotated version of the monthly release , which both identified the geolocation of the event \u2013 and also , where possible , specifically cross matched Credible incidents to coded events already in the Airwars database .\nThis locational information was provided by CJTFOIR on the expectation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own database of civilian harm events .\nBy early 2018 the Coalition was consistently providing MGRS data every month to Airwars for both Credible and later , for \u2018 Non Credible \u2019 events .\nHowever this still left 126 historical confirmed cases for which Airwars had no locational data .\nIn early 2019 , Airwars asked both the Coalition and the US Department of Defense to release this information \u2013 arguing that the alliance \u2019 s significant transparency in confirming civilian harm cases was being weakened by our then being unable publicly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was also argued that the US could better distinguish itself from Russia and other belligerents , who instead chose to hide or deny civilian harm from their own actions .\nThe missing locational data was provided to Airwars in Summer 2019 by the Coalition \u2019 s civilian casualty assessment team \u2013 a major step forward for transparency and public accountability .\nLater that year , the Coalition also began publishing MGRS data as part of its regular monthly public reporting .\nThe Credibles dataset offers significant potential for visualisations , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm event in both Iraq and Syria to be precisely mapped and timelined .\nAdditionally , each event can be cross matched to an associated Airwars incident report .\nMore than 900 victim names are linked , along with associated photographs , videos , witness statements , and satellite imagery analysis of bomb sites .\nAirwars has built a new subsite illustrating the remarkable potential of this unique transparency dataset .\nEach US-led Coalition Credible event has been precisely mapped down to at least 100 metres , and timelined across the war .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affected communities led us to create an interface that would make the dataset easily accessible , and represent the information in a way that reflected its accuracy , \u201d says Lizzie Malcolm of Scottish-American design team Rectangle , which conceived the new subsite .\nThe Credibles data sets a new benchmark for US military accountability for civilian harm .\nIt \u2019 s hoped that the release of such accurate geolocational data can now become standard both for the US military and its allies .", "author": "Chris Woods", "url":
