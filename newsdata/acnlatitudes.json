is a naturopathic physician specializing in classical homeopathy .\nHe is a long-standing Diplomate of the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians , served as president of the Academy for five years , and was editor of the Academy \u2019 s international journal for six years .\nAn author , educator , and lecturer , Dr. Tessler is practicing in south Surrey , British Columbia .\nEditor : This informative article began as a letter from Dr. Neil Tessler to his patients and friends .\nOne of our advisory board members shared it with me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish it , with hopes that readers will find it helpful during this difficult time .\nIt is not intended to be applicable to all readers , nor did the author intend it to be taken as specific medical advice .\nI wanted to share my findings after a period of research as well as a number of seminars with top practitioners .\nFirstly , though , as a disclaimer , it is necessary to say that my presentation here is for general informational purposes and is not meant to promote any preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNaturopathic physicians in British Columbia have been designated an essential service and are following very closely the guidelines given out to health care practitioners by the Provincial Health Officer .\nI \u2019 ve left how my office is operating to the end of this paper .\nOf course , I \u2019 m going to keep this as simple as can be .\nMuch will be repetition from what you may have already learned .\nSome will be new .\nAlong with all of the necessary personal and social behaviors being promoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth considering some of the research that may have relevance to the current situation .\nI \u2019 ve also provided plentiful scientific references for those who would like to delve more deeply .\nThis article focuses on naturopathic considerations .\nIn the next article I \u2019 ll be discussing what \u2019 s been going on in the homeopathy world around Covid-19 and the homeopathic experience in past epidemics .\nJust yesterday I learned that my nephew was ill with what has been confirmed to be Covid-19 .\nHe has a wife and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToday I spoke with him and questioned him in detail regarding his experience , and believe me , none of us would want to go through it .\nI then spoke with his wife and reviewed all the measures she is employing to help herself and this was a great discussion .\nNotably , a number of his work colleagues are ill but have not been tested , which tells us that the true count is well ahead of what is reported .\nThis also illustrates in several ways the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who is infected until they have isolated long enough to pass through the incubation stage , which can go all the way to three weeks .\nPeople feeling fine could be vectors of infection , as could their co-workers or family , so we have to avoid a false sense of security .\nControl freaks are having a huge healing right now as they finally realize we don \u2019 t control much and finally let it go .\nNevertheless , we can , with an effort of will , control our behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulent ( which essentially means harmful ) organism .\nSo it is easily transmitted and easily able to do its dirty work .\nIn the process of infection , once the virus attaches to a cell and then enters , it develops by activating a specific factor in the cellular fluid called an NLRP3 inflammasome .\nYou don \u2019 t have to remember NLRP3 .\nIn act , forget I even said it .\nThe important point is that this inflammasome activates the release of a complex family of immune factors known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness caused by Covid-19 .\nBy now you may have heard the term \u201c cytokine storm \u201d , which refers to an immune system gone wild .\nCytokines are a normal part of the immune system , though under various circumstances they can trigger severe local inflammation , as in rheumatoid arthritis .\nA Cytokine Storm is when too many cytokines are released too quickly , leading to fever , inflammation , and the array of symptoms associated with the illness .\nOf course , there are various other intriguing biochemical points around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular environment , but enough , as they say , is enough .\nThe severity of the infection depends on two main factors .\nFirst is the basic health status of the individual .\nThis includes any underlying conditions , the ways in which medications effect immune function , as well as nutritional status .\nStress is another risk factor as it has so many harmful effects on the body , including increasing inflammation and depressing immune function .\nSo chill out , get enough rest , breathe deeply , and learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportune time .\nThe second basic risk factor is age , as many of the most potent defensive and restorative systems within the body are less efficient with age .\nAge-related health issues such as cardiovascular or respiratory illness , and all of the other wide-ranging biological changes that go along with aging , can be a dangerous combination .\nI happen to be sensitive to this subject as I qualify for a pension this summer !\nSo in our review of research with some potential relevance , we have tried to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increase the immune systems ability to kill viruses , prevent viruses from attaching to cells , prevent viral replication within the cell , or reduce the activation of inflammasomes and other cellular factors that lead to serious illness .\nOne of the most interesting things I have learned though , is that virtually everything that has relevance to preventing viral infection , is also relevant to cancer prevention .\nI have nothing more to say about that here , but wanted to share that finding .\nA clear conclusion from all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food diet , rich in variety and color , is your first , most important line of defense .\nEven the elements that give foods their color are potent , antioxidant .\nand anti-inflammatory nutrients .\nSome have been shown to reduce inflammasome signals that can lead to a cascade of inflammatory factors .\nSo eat plenty of fresh vegetables , fruits , berries , nuts and seeds .\nI would particularly mention broccoli sprouts due to their rich content of sulforaphanes , though broccoli , cauliflower , cabbage , and kale are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current novel coronavirus is activated by an enzyme called TMPRSS2 .\nSulforaphanes , besides dampening inflammation , directly inhibit this enzyme .\nGreen tea catechins also inhibit the secretion of TMPRSS2 .\nAlso legumes , i.e.\n, beans , as well as grains such as millet , buckwheat , quinoa , and rice are all rich sources of macro and micro nutrients as well as a wide variety of phytochemicals , unique plant chemicals with health promoting and anti-aging value .\nIn fact , inadequate nutrient status is a major risk factor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a high quality multi-vitamin/multi mineral supplement .\nThere are various micronutrients that help maintain strong immune function , such as zinc and selenium .\nDiet alone can be insufficient and a general supplement can ensure that you \u2019 re covered .\nI would not recommend garden variety drug store formulas such as Centrum , as the quality of the nutrients and secondary ingredients are much less in tune with our natural physiology .\nBetter to consider natural food stores or natural health professionals .\nThe typical natural food store customer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard , therefore the companies are more competitive and produce better products to impress the market .\nThis is useful because the form of a nutrient that you take can make a big difference in assimilation and utilization .\nI was sent an audio by six people on the same day of a woman with an Aussie accent claiming to be giving advice from a Spanish doctor .\nIt wasn \u2019 t all that credible to me but she spoke about gargling , so I did a little research on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gargling with green tea or salt water can be a very useful factor in lowering the risk of viral infection .\nDrinking green tea also has important benefits due to the potent green tea catechins .\nPlease note that these suggestions are provided with the understanding that individual needs may vary ; no protocol can apply to everyone .\nAlso , breastfeeding mothers should consult with a knowledgeable practitioner for supplementation .\nVitamin C \u2013 1-2 grams three times daily with meals .\nFor kids above three years of age , 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well more than would normally be needed .\nVitamin C inhibits inflammasome activation and improves the outcome of upper respiratory infections .\nFor a variety of reasons , metabolic requirements go up significantly with infection , so double or even triple your dose if you become ill .\nSome hospitals are using IV infusions .\nVitamin D \u2013 5000 IU daily with meals .\nFor children aged one and above , 400 to 1000 is adequate , the higher range being appropriate to regions with less sun .\nThis is a preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the immune system is significant .\nVitamin D supplementation is important generally as vitamin D deficiency is quite common in northern climates .\nZinc \u2013 20 to 25 mg daily for adults .\nChildren from infancy to three years 3 \u2013 5 mg ; for growing children around 10 mg. is adequate through to the late teens .\nZinc is one of our top anti-viral and immune support nutrients .\nIt improves the function of white blood cells , an essential aspect of our immune defense and prevents the entry of viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess cytokine production .\nN-acetyl Cysteine \u2013 500 mg twice daily .\nThis nutrient increases levels of glutathione , the body \u2019 s master antioxidant .\nIt protects the energy engine of the cell , as well as various organ systems .\nIt improves mucous clearance in the lungs , improves lung function , and helps protect against lung damage .\nIt also disrupts bacterial communities called biofilms .\nQuercetin \u2013 Quercetin is a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables , and is particularly rich in apples and onions , particularly onion skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye and the pigment itself is the quercetin .\nSimply pour boiling water over onion skins and allow it to sit for thirty minutes , strain then drink it .\nAdd a little miso and voila !\nI \u2019 m not saying you should do this , I \u2019 m saying you could do this but , to make a long story short , if its not organic , don \u2019 t bother !\nAbsorption of quercetin from onions is twice that of tea and three times that of apples .\nQuercetin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current situation , it inhibits the ability of viruses to establish an infection through several mechanisms including preventing their entry into cells and reducing replication of the viruses that do enter .\nTo achieve benefits , supplemental doses of about 500 mg twice daily with meals are required .\nMelatonin \u2013 Melatonin is not just for sleep .\nNo , no , no !\nYes , it can give you wild dreams .\nYes , yes , yes !\nMelatonin is a potent inhibitor of NLPR3 ( oops ! )\ninflammasones , helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s energy engine , the mitochondria , is antioxidant , and lowers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines .\nMelatonin can also prevent lung injury that can be associated with mechanical ventilators .\nMelatonin levels fall very significantly with age .\nA child can have ten times the level of melatonin as a healthy adult senior .\nIs there a relationship between melatonin levels and the far greater impact of the coronavirus on seniors ?\nAn interesting question .\nEven a half to one mg taken in the evening can be a valuable supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a teenager , I couldn \u2019 t get that excited about herbal medicine as the information around any given herb seemed so general and imprecise .\nIn the many years since , herbal medicine has gained a far greater foothold in research .\nSo much so that there is a huge and ever expanding world of information on the chemistry and bioactivity of a vast array of medicinal herbs .\nSo as not to drag this already long article too much further , I \u2019 m going to simply list some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inflammatory pathways associated with coronavirus , general immune system benefits and antiviral activity .\nFormulations based on some or all of these plants may be useful considerations at this time .\nAstragalus \u2013 Anti-viral , anti-inflammatory Andrographis \u2013 A very potent broad spectrum anti-viral .\nRather exceptionally bitter .\nLicorice \u2013 Anti-viral , anti-stress , improves absorption of nutrients .\nCaution : Dose matters as it can stimulate high blood pressure .\nHoly Basil \u2013 Anti-stress , broad spectrum anti-bacterial , anti-viral , anti-fungal Mentha \u2013 Anti-viral , anti-inflammatory Medicinal Mushrooms ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tail , Cordyceps ) \u2013 Excellent immune support and anti-viral .\nOlive Leaf \u2013 Anti-viral , anti-inflammatory , protects the entire cardiovascular system Scutellaria baicalensis \u2013 Potent anti-inflammatory and viral inhibition Nettle \u2013 Reduces cytokine release and reduces a range of associated inflammatory factors Elecampagne \u2013 Prevention and support for lung inflammation Elderberry extract \u2013 Despite the controversy , experts agree that Elderberry , at least up to the point of symptoms , has many potential benefits and should not be ignored .\nA fairly potent anti-viral herb that also tastes great .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to continue offering appointments via Skype , Face Time , Facebook Messenger video , What \u2019 s App or phone .\nTo my experience , online video is as good as in person for first time case-taking and follow-up .\nDetails for appointments are found on the online appointment system at my website or by phoning the office .\nSuitable arrangements will be made for safe pick up or shipping via courier or Canada Post of homeopathic remedies and natural products .\nAt this remarkable juncture through which we are all passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world be like afterwards , when billions of people have shared such a dramatic , life changing experience \u2013 even if they are not impacted personally , but the physical distancing , the time away from work ?\nWhat will change in our values and priorities and what will remain ?\nIf we can appreciate that we are in some kind of world altering gestation , do we want that to be based on fear or do we want that to be based on love ?\nNow is an opportunity if you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to journal , to learn to meditate .\nYou may wish to check out my free meditation program on the website .\nYou may also consider reviewing the Regenerative Nutrition series of videos .\nIt \u2019 s long , but I suspect you \u2019 ll have lots of time .\nAll found under the

Mother\u2019s Letter", "content": "Dear Sheila , I am writing to you because our family has been affected by Tourette \u2019 s Syndrome and I want to thank you for your work as an educator and advocate in this area .\nMy son was diagnosed with Tourette \u2019 s two years ago when he turned 7 .\nHis tics started gradually about a year before his official diagnosis , .\nThe diagnosis was not a surprise , but what did surprise me was how quickly they went from mild to fairly severe .\nWe live in Nova Scotia , Canada .\nReading your book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s , helped give me the courage to step outside the conventional medicine box to help him .\nI used to think Tourette \u2019 s was a specific genetic condition .\nAlthough I agree there are definite genetic factors , I now view Tourette \u2019 s as a symptom of one or more underlying problems .\nI want to start by stating that my son does not have OCD , autism , ADHD , or other conditions that often accompany Tourette \u2019 s , or rather , there are no major indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grade 3 and eats well .\nI have a background in nutritional sciences and enjoy cooking .\nHis diet has always been well balanced and he eats a variety of foods including regular omega-3 and probiotic supplements .\nWhen he was a toddler , however , he suffered from severe constipation .\nLong story short , after removing dairy , gluten , and processed sugar from his diet based on an IgG food sensitivity test through a naturopath , the issue very quickly resolved .\nHe followed this diet for nearly 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to a regular diet and he seemed to be doing fine .\nThen , when he was 4 1/2 he was hospitalized for nearly a week with a staph infection ( scalded skin syndrome ) requiring a course of IV antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics .\nI strongly believe these events played a significant role in the onset of his Tourette \u2019 s .\nStatistics show that a considerable percentage of those with Tourette \u2019 s also suffer from various digestive problems and there is no doubt in my mind there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there isn \u2019 t more scientific research in this area .\nTo date , his tics have decreased significantly .\nOver last few months he has virtually no motor tics , and his vocal tics are quite mild .\nIf I had to place a number on it , I would say we are seeing about an 80-90 % decrease .\nI started compiling a detailed summary and analysis of each treatment and trial we have completed , but for now I want to share with you our general success .\nConsidering everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our overall success can be attributed to magnesium , immunotherapy , and faith .\nMagnesium was the first treatment where we noticed a difference in the tics .\nWe switched from magnesium citrate to \u201c Mag Matrix \u201d which is a combination of magnesium glycinate , citrate , and malate and more easily absorbed and works less like a laxative than some others .\nHis target dose was determined by the amount given to achieve about one \u201c normal \u201d formed stool per day .\nFor our son , this was about 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , we saw our first signs of a decrease in motor tics .\nThey were becoming less noticeable during the day with activity , indicating it was making a positive difference .\nRelated to this , I want to point out that my son frequently complained of stomach aches and leg pain at bedtime .\nSince he did not really complain about this during the day , my husband and I often wondered if it was a tactic to delay bedtime , or perhaps a response to feeling afraid .\nWe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c growing pains \u201d .\nRemarkably , once we started our son on magnesium , his stomach ache and leg pain complaints completely vanished .\nIn December 2018 , nearly a year after his Tourette \u2019 s was officially diagnosed , our naturopath suggested trying low dose immunotherapy ( LDI ) using streptococcus .\nBasically , this treatment is giving the body very low doses of the bacteria to activate an immune response to it and strengthen the immune system .\nStrep infections are often connected to Tourette-like symptoms , etc .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago did not indicate strep was a problem , his stool sample several months prior did indicate an overgrowth of this bacteria , so I was willing to try .\nIf strep was not a problem , my naturopath indicated this treatment would show no changes .\nIf so , we would notice changes rather quickly and need to work with dosing to determine the optimal level .\nThe plan was to start with the lowest dose and work up to the highest dose every two days .\nIf the dose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen .\nIf the dose is too high , an increase or flare-up of symptoms would be noted , and if just right , a decrease in symptoms would be observed .\nWe had some ups and downs until we found the right dose with the naturopath \u2019 s help .\nWe literally saw a noticeable decrease in his vocal tics within 2 hours of taking this dose .\nWhen we gave him the same dose two days later , we saw the same response and I remember for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so quiet and peaceful falling asleep .\nI cried .\nThe entire process was not easy , but it was worth it .\nWe have been able to introduce select foods without a problem .\nI list faith because this has been part of a spiritual journey for me .\nWhen I tell people our story and all we have done , the response is often \u201c your son is very lucky to have you as a mom.\n\u201d I really believe there is purpose to all of this .\nA year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and enrolled in nursing school to become a registered nurse .\nI was already university educated with a master \u2019 s degree in nutritional sciences and had a good job .\nNursing was not something I always wanted to do , but I was feeling \u201c unsettled , \u201d and nursing kept \u201c coming up \u201d in my quest to find greater purpose .\nMy son \u2019 s diagnosis came one year into an intense two-year program .\nI think my science background , combined with my newfound nursing/medical knowledge gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative therapies .\nI also came across your book , Natural Treatments for Tics & Tourette \u2019 s one day and started carpooling with a classmate who I later found out was diagnosed with Tourette \u2019 s as a child .\nI also take comfort in the scriptures .\nI trust that God \u2019 s purpose is greater than our problems , and knowing he loves us has brought me comfort and perspective .\nSo this is where we are right now : Overall , his motor tics are virtually gone and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe is still getting the immunotherapy doses on a regular bases and we are learning what doses to give and when , based on his symptoms , for best results .\nHe is still taking magnesium , but only about 200 mg per day .\nAdditionally , he gets daily omega-3 , probiotic and vitamin D supplements .\nThe omega-3 and probiotic were regular supplements before his Tourette \u2019 s surfaced , but the vitamin D3 began at the start of his diagnosis when his blood work indicated he was low .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ other natural approaches under the guidance of our naturopath in an effort to determine all root causes .\nAnd while we try to minimize \u201c junk \u201d we are currently not restricting specific foods .\nPerhaps if we did , we would see even greater improvement , but for now we are trying to maintain a happy balance .\nI have learned so much over the last couple of years including how much more there is to learn .\nIt is unfortunate more effort and funding hasn \u2019 t been placed on research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health categories it seems little emphasis is placed on natural or preventative approaches , and that needs to change .\nI am very grateful for your hard work and efforts over the years to educate and advocate for change .\nI want to be part of the solution , so I hope this information and our experiences can help others .\nFeel free to pass this information on .", "author": "Reader Article", "url": "https://latitudes.org/helping-our-son-with-tourettes-a-mothers-letter/", "published": "Fri,

from standard advice and search for answers on your own .\nCongratulations on taking the first steps .\nThe list below is offered to help steer you in new directions .\nTourette syndrome has been proven to be both a genetic AND an environmental disorder .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ research community , it is ignored by conventional physicians in clinical practice , and that \u2019 s a major problem .\nEnvironmental influences include issues like diet , nutrients , allergens , medications , infection , mental/emotional state , toxins , and more .\n( See # 2 below for more on this . )\nUnfortunately , conventional neurologists and pediatricians rarely address environmental factors for Tourette \u2019 s , aside from stress .\nThey seem to be unaware of research that links tics to allergies and immune functioning .\nThey don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time and better at another .\nThey don \u2019 t look for \u201c causes \u201d of the tics in the same way that doctors typically look for what is causing a headache , or difficulty breathing , for example .\nThis is because they don \u2019 t question the out-dated concept that Tourette \u2019 s is a genetics-only disorder , even when this leaves them few options for successful treatment .\nDepending on a child \u2019 s age and severity of tic symptoms , a doctor treating Tourette syndrome may recommend reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy , or resorting to deep brain stimulation ( which requires electrodes to be implanted in the brain ) .\nThe worst part of this scenario is that doctors , while failing to provide help in this area , often discourage you from looking for your own answers to Tourette syndrome : \u2022 \u201c There \u2019 s nothing you can do.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Studies don \u2019 t support

success stories on our website written by others for encouragement .\nAs you embark on this journey , be aware that family members may not be supportive .\nYour child may have heard the doctor say diet doesn \u2019 t matter .\nThere will be challenges .\nBut keep your goal in mind and be strong in your resolve .\nNot understanding what is meant by \u201c environmental factors \u201d We tend to think of the term environment as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the word has a different meaning in medicine .\nIn medicine , your environment refers to just about everything outside genetics .\nConsider what you eat , drink , breathe , touch , smell , and think or feel , as environmental factors .\nThere \u2019 s a medical field called \u201c Environmental Medicine \u201d that focuses in this area .\nBeing educated on this topic is valuable , because controlling troublesome environmental factors whenever possible can make a big difference in symptoms .\nIt can seem overwhelming to consider all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in developing or aggravating tics .\nBut you don \u2019 t have to absorb all the concepts at once , and we offer free worksheets to help you .\nThe more you learn , the more comfortable you will be with the approach .\nAnd , the more likely you \u2019 ll be able to zero in on the environmental factors that are affecting your situation .\nHere \u2019 s a way to think about the environment for tics Imagine you child woke up and then spent the next few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You noticed that tics were mild when she woke up , but they are much more significant by noon .\nAn environmental review of this situation could include things like : \u2022 Did she sleep well ?\n\u2022 Might she have cold or other infection ?\n\u2022 What did she eat and drink for breakfast and snacks ?\n\u2022 Did she take medications or supplements ?\n\u2022 Did she play video games , watch TV , or spend time on a mobile device ?\n\u2022 Are there scented candles or \u201c plug-ins \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Did she get exposed to a family member \u2019 s perfume or aftershave ?\n\u2022 Is she worried ?\nDid she get frustrated or have a problem with a sibling ?\n\u2022 Did she play with a pet ?\n\u2022 Are any of the rooms where she spent time moldy or dusty ?\n\u2022 Did she encounter strong cleansers , scented detergents/fabric softener , or pesticides ?\nThese are just examples .\nThe approach is like solving a puzzle , and it can take time to get a clear picture of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation .\nTrust me , once you start the process will be second nature to explore what might be affecting her nervous system .\n( See Mistake # 6 for more on this ) An environmental assessment moves your thinking beyond dietary change and nutritional supplements .\nBoth can be important , but you need to be more comprehensive .\nDon \u2019 t overlook allergens and chemicals as nervous system triggers .\nYou might decide to change the diet , but if your child is reacting to something else , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the topics included in the questions above can potentially aggravate tics in some people .\nAssuming Tourette \u2019 s is a single condition and everyone will respond in the same way We encourage families to share experiences in their search for answers to tic symptoms .\nIt \u2019 s a great way to find new solutions .\nThe more people who report that dietary change , or allergy control , or nutritional support , or \u201c going chemical-free or natural \u201d helped , for example , the more impetus there is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to remember , though , that people are biologically different .\nJust looking at the different ways individuals react to the same medication confirms this .\nIt \u2019 s human nature to hope that if one child seemed better after taking B vitamins , or by staying off dairy ( just as examples ) , that your child will also benefit .\nAll things being equal , these approaches could truly help , if your child needed more B vitamins , or has an allergy or intolerance to dairy .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d or underlying issues , may be completely different .\nRead successful reports to come up with ideas to explore , then expand those ideas to meet the needs of your situation .\nOur latest book includes helpful insights from a large number of families , and explains more on identifying and removing triggers .\n( Link below ) Focusing on only one intervention at a time There \u2019 s a theory that when looking at the effectiveness of interventions , you should only do one thing at a time so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach has obvious value .\nBut there \u2019 s a big caveat .\nFor nervous system disorders like Tourette \u2019 s , it is rare that there is a single factor that is causing or aggravating the tics .\nIt \u2019 s possible , of course , but not typical .\nI suggest using an approach I call \u201c leveling the playing field \u201d before you start in on key interventions you want to explore .\nThe goal with this is to remove some common tic triggers first , ones that could throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By taking some common sense steps that are a healthful for all of us , you will make your investigative work more fruitful .\nBelow is what I suggest in my book Stop Your Tics by Learning What Triggers Them .\n\u2022 Eliminate foods/drinks with caffeine , artificial flavors , colors , and preservatives .\nRead labels and try to be strict and consistent .\n\u2022 Make a note now of any foods that , based on previous observa\u00adtion , you suspect might be aggravating tics .\nPlan to avoid them .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including honey and maple syrup , and do not use artificial sweeteners like Nutrasweet/Equal .\n\u2022 Replace chemically-scented products in the home with natural , unscented products .\n\u2022 Create an allergy-free bedroom for the child .\n\u2022 Reduce/limit television viewing , video games , and screen time throughout the day .\n( Of course this is now a special challenge with online learning . )\n\u2022 Use organic foods when possible , and give your child purified water .\nAfter a couple of weeks with these efforts , make a note if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or severity .\nOnce your hunt for specific triggers is underway , continue with the above suggestions as best you can .\nIn it , Dr. Doris Rapp describes a young boy with a diagnosis of severe Tourette syndrome .\nShe tells how the family went on national television ( The Phil Donahue Show ) with her .\nShe explained that his tics were in response to allergens and other environmental factors .\nWith Dr. Rapp \u2019 s help the family was able to control his serious tics .\nNeurologists and pediatricians don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut-brain connection with tics .\nThat \u2019 s because they have not been taught that it exists .\nMore than 30 years ago , pioneering leaders like Drs William Crook , Doris Rapp , William Philpott , and Marshall Mandell emphasized the important role of intestinal health for nervous system and brain functioning .\nThey were lambasted and ridiculed by their peers .\nYet during the last 10 years , especially , research has piled up to clearly support these doctors \u2019 clinical findings .\nBe aware that food allergies and sensitivities might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child \u2019 s tics .\nFor some , eating corn can set off tics .\nFor someone else , the worst offender may be red food dye .\nYet another may have to avoid gluen and a few other foods/drinks .\nThe list of potential offenders can be substantial .\nImportantly , a yeast overgrowth such as Candida albicans can wreck havoc , increasing the negative response to foods .\nWhile watching for food reactions , it \u2019 s wise to consider yeast overgrowth as underlying a gut-brain reaction .\nAll types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase Candida albicans , a natural yeast that is present in everyone \u2019 s body .\nWhen it is kept in check , it is harmless .\nHowever , when it grows out of control , problems can ensue .\nFriendly intestinal bacteria such as Bifidobacteria bifidum and Lactobaccillus acidophilus typically provide a balance to keep C albicans and other yeasts in check .\nBesides improper diet and sweets , antibiotics , nutritional deficiencies , corticosteroids , and immune deficiencies can allow C albicans to increase out of control , resulting in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below offers a concise explanation of how candida can be assessed and treated .\nFailing to keep a log on foods , exposures , and symptoms Keeping a detailed log ( as best you can ! )\nhas been the answer for many parents .\nIt \u2019 s a good idea to keep a record of foods and drinks , exposures , and activities during the day , along with tic symptoms and whether they are better or worse .\nApproaches vary , with some parents doing detailed recording of the times per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others using a scale of 1 to 10 , while still others might create their own plan , such as just using a symbol , like an up or down arrow or smiley face to show if symptoms were better or worse .\nWhatever works for you , please know that the exercise can be useful .\nBy writing things down , you have the chance to go back later and review your notations , looking for clues .\nIt may seem like a lot of work .\nBut let \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of a condition that the medical community has no good answers for !\nYour effort in itself is amazing .\nYes , it \u2019 s going to take some detective work , but you can pace yourself and just do as much as you are comfortable with .\nI \u2019 ve had parents tell me it was easier to keep a log than to lie in bed at night in despair , assuming there was nothing they could do to help their child .\nReady-made charts ( for you and your child @ @

trials needed to solve your child \u2019 s health issues .\nThe advice of an integrative practitioner can be invaluable in exploring new approaches , or in determining if specialized laboratory

infectious disease , bodywork , dentistry , or other fields may be helpful .\nIt all depends on what your child \u2019 s underlying health issues are that are part of the overall picture .\nWe cover these topics in our books .\nTo make this point , Dr. Doris Rapp often used the example of trying to relieve the pain of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot hurts , you can try interventions like a salve or a bandaid , but if the problem stems from a nail in your shoe , you have to remove the nail .\nSometimes your own efforts will give you the solutions you are hoping for , but other times you \u2019 ll need to reach out for assistance to have the best outcome .\nAs you go on this journey to help your child , keep expanding your self-education .\nIf you hit a wall in your efforts , try to avoid @ @ @

@ @ @ But the word has a different meaning in medicine .\nIn medicine , your environment refers to just about everything outside genetics .\nConsider what you eat , drink , breathe , touch , smell , and think or feel , as environmental factors .\nThere \u2019 s a medical field called \u201c Environmental Medicine \u201d that focuses in this area .\nBeing educated on this topic is valuable , because controlling troublesome environmental factors whenever possible can make a big difference in symptoms .\nIt can seem overwhelming to consider all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in developing or aggravating tics .\nBut you don \u2019 t have to absorb all the concepts at once , and we offer free worksheets to help you .\nThe more you learn , the more comfortable you will be with the approach .\nAnd , the more likely you \u2019 ll be able to zero in on the environmental factors that are affecting your situation .\nHere \u2019 s a way to think about the environment for tics Imagine you child woke up and then spent the next few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You noticed that tics were mild when she woke up , but they are much more significant by noon .\nAn environmental review of this situation could include things like : \u2022 Did she sleep well ?\n\u2022 Might she have cold or other infection ?\n\u2022 What did she eat and drink for breakfast and snacks ?\n\u2022 Did she take medications or supplements ?\n\u2022 Did she play video games , watch TV , or spend time on a mobile device ?\n\u2022 Are there scented candles or \u201c plug-ins \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Did she get exposed to a family member \u2019 s perfume or aftershave ?\n\u2022 Is she worried ?\nDid she get frustrated or have a problem with a sibling ?\n\u2022 Did she play with a pet ?\n\u2022 Are any of the rooms where she spent time moldy or dusty ?\n\u2022 Did she encounter strong cleansers , scented detergents/fabric softener , or pesticides ?\nThese are just examples .\nThe approach is like solving a puzzle , and it can take time to get a clear picture of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation .\nTrust me , once you start the process will be second nature to explore what might be affecting her nervous system .\n( See Mistake # 6 for more on this ) An environmental assessment moves your thinking beyond dietary change and nutritional supplements .\nBoth can be important , but you need to be more comprehensive .\nDon \u2019 t overlook allergens and chemicals as nervous system triggers .\nYou might decide to change the diet , but if your child is reacting to something else , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the topics included in the questions above can potentially aggravate tics in some people .\nAssuming Tourette \u2019 s is a single condition and everyone will respond in the same way We encourage families to share experiences in their search for answers to tic symptoms .\nIt \u2019 s a great way to find new solutions .\nThe more people who report that dietary change , or allergy control , or nutritional support , or \u201c going chemical-free or natural \u201d helped , for example , the more impetus there is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to remember , though , that people are biologically different .\nJust looking at the different ways individuals react to the same medication confirms this .\nIt \u2019 s human nature to hope that if one child seemed better after taking B vitamins , or by staying off dairy ( just as examples ) , that your child will also benefit .\nAll things being equal , these approaches could truly help , if your child needed more B vitamins , or has an allergy or intolerance to dairy .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d or underlying issues , may be completely different .\nRead successful reports to come up with ideas to explore , then expand those ideas to meet the needs of your situation .\nOur latest book includes helpful insights from a large number of families , and explains more on identifying and removing triggers .\n( Link below ) Focusing on only one intervention at a time There \u2019 s a theory that when looking at the effectiveness of interventions , you should only do one thing at a time so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach has obvious value .\nBut there \u2019 s a big caveat .\nFor nervous system disorders like Tourette \u2019 s , it is rare that there is a single factor that is causing or aggravating the tics .\nIt \u2019 s possible , of course , but not typical .\nI suggest using an approach I call \u201c leveling the playing field \u201d before you start in on key interventions you want to explore .\nThe goal with this is to remove some common tic triggers first , ones that could throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By taking some common sense steps that are a healthful for all of us , you will make your investigative work more fruitful .\nBelow is what I suggest in my book Stop Your Tics by Learning What Triggers Them .\n\u2022 Eliminate foods/drinks with caffeine , artificial flavors , colors , and preservatives .\nRead labels and try to be strict and consistent .\n\u2022 Make a note now of any foods that , based on previous observa\u00adtion , you suspect might be aggravating tics .\nPlan to avoid them .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including honey and maple syrup , and do not use artificial sweeteners like Nutrasweet/Equal .\n\u2022 Replace chemically-scented products in the home with natural , unscented products .\n\u2022 Create an allergy-free bedroom for the child .\n\u2022 Reduce/limit television viewing , video games , and screen time throughout the day .\n( Of course this is now a special challenge with online learning . )\n\u2022 Use organic foods when possible , and give your child purified water .\nAfter a couple of weeks with these efforts , make a note if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or severity .\nOnce your hunt for specific triggers is underway , continue with the above suggestions as best you can .\nIn it , Dr. Doris Rapp describes a young boy with a diagnosis of severe Tourette syndrome .\nShe tells how the family went on national television ( The Phil Donahue Show ) with her .\nShe explained that his tics were in response to allergens and other environmental factors .\nWith Dr. Rapp \u2019 s help the family was able to control his serious tics .\nNeurologists and pediatricians don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut-brain connection with tics .\nThat \u2019 s because they have not been taught that it exists .\nMore than 30 years ago , pioneering leaders like Drs William Crook , Doris Rapp , William Philpott , and Marshall Mandell emphasized the important role of intestinal health for nervous system and brain functioning .\nThey were lambasted and ridiculed by their peers .\nYet during the last 10 years , especially , research has piled up to clearly support these doctors \u2019 clinical findings .\nBe aware that food allergies and sensitivities might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child \u2019 s tics .\nFor some , eating corn can set off tics .\nFor someone else , the worst offender may be red food dye .\nYet another may have to avoid gluen and a few other foods/drinks .\nThe list of potential offenders can be substantial .\nImportantly , a yeast overgrowth such as Candida albicans can wreck havoc , increasing the negative response to foods .\nWhile watching for food reactions , it \u2019 s wise to consider yeast overgrowth as underlying a gut-brain reaction .\nAll types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase Candida albicans , a natural yeast that is present in everyone \u2019 s body .\nWhen it is kept in check , it is harmless .\nHowever , when it grows out of control , problems can ensue .\nFriendly intestinal bacteria such as Bifidobacteria bifidum and Lactobaccillus acidophilus typically provide a balance to keep C albicans and other yeasts in check .\nBesides improper diet and sweets , antibiotics , nutritional deficiencies , corticosteroids , and immune deficiencies can allow C albicans to increase out of control , resulting in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below offers a concise explanation of how candida can be assessed and treated .\nFailing to keep a log on foods , exposures , and symptoms Keeping a detailed log ( as best you can ! )\nhas been the answer for many parents .\nIt \u2019 s a good idea to keep a record of foods and drinks , exposures , and activities during the day , along with tic symptoms and whether they are better or worse .\nApproaches vary , with some parents doing detailed recording of the times per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others using a scale of 1 to 10 , while still others might create their own plan , such as just using a symbol , like an up or down arrow or smiley face to show if symptoms were better or worse .\nWhatever works for you , please know that the exercise can be useful .\nBy writing things down , you have the chance to go back later and review your notations , looking for clues .\nIt may seem like a lot of work .\nBut let \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of a condition that the medical community has no good answers for !\nYour effort in itself is amazing .\nYes , it \u2019 s going to take some detective work , but you can pace yourself and just do as much as you are comfortable with .\nI \u2019 ve had parents tell me it was easier to keep a log than to lie in bed at night in despair , assuming there was nothing they could do to help their child .\nReady-made charts ( for you and your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSee the link below .\nTrying to \u201c go it alone \u201d when professional help is needed Sometimes a case is too complex , or a parent too overwhelmed , to successfully undertake the trials needed to solve your child \u2019 s health issues .\nThe advice of an integrative practitioner can be invaluable in exploring new approaches , or in determining if specialized laboratory testing and/or medical intervention is required .\nBeing an \u201c investigator \u201d and implementing changes yourself may require more effort and energy than you have .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend needed support in directing your efforts .\nIn some cases , physicians or practitioners skilled in nutritional medicine , chemical sensitivities , detoxification , immune function and allergy , infectious disease , bodywork , dentistry , or other fields may be helpful .\nIt all depends on what your child \u2019 s underlying health issues are that are part of the overall picture .\nWe cover these topics in our books .\nTo make this point , Dr. Doris Rapp often used the example of trying to relieve the pain of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot hurts , you can try interventions like a salve or a bandaid , but if the problem stems from a nail in your shoe , you have to remove the nail .\nSometimes your own efforts will give you the solutions you are hoping for , but other times you \u2019 ll need to reach out for assistance to have the best outcome .\nAs you go on this journey to help your child , keep expanding your self-education .\nIf you hit a wall in your efforts , try to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and look for support .\nAbove all , keep an open mind .\nYou are your child \u2019 s best hope .", "author": "Sheila Rogers DeMare, MS", "url":

the least where we were living .\nWe just wanted to spare our son the intense pain he was going through .\nWhen he was 10 years old , our son David almost died from debilitating conventional medications for a serious case of Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .\nFortunately , with professional help and self-determination , David was weaned from those drugs , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost losing our son I feel a moral obligation to share our story .\nI pray that others who may be in need of answers , as we were , may find the path they need .\nOur son has genetically-inherited Tourette syndrome .\nThe initial symptoms came on gradually , starting at around age five .\nInitial tics were eye-rolling and throat-clearing .\nA practitioner advised us that David \u2019 s eye-rolling was due to his weak vision , for which he got corrective glasses .\nHis throat-clearing was dismissed as allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bright and artistic , an educational psychologist said he had attention deficit disorder .\nHe also received a diagnosis of central auditory processing disorder and sensory dysfunction .\nHe was given an Individual Educational Plan at school .\nAbout two years later , symptoms worsened .\nIt was just before David \u2019 s 10th birthday .\nMultiple severe tics ( including some that were self-injurious ) , major OCD symptoms , and depression came on very suddenly .\nAlong with this were anxiety and incredibly intense symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgoing , bright , and social to being withdrawn , anxious , antisocial , phobic , and disinterested in everything .\nExamples of his OCD were repetitive actions to get things \u201c just right , \u201d obsessive fears , and phobias .\nA pediatric psychiatrist later told us that David exhibited \u201c Tourettic OCD , \u201d a condition in which tics and OCD tend to morph into one another .\nWe took David to a neurologist , who diagnosed Tourette syndrome and recommended the antipsychotic medication Haldol .\nWe were initially resistant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his school , we relented .\n( Editor : Haldol used to be the medication of choice for Tourette syndrome and is now used less often due to safety concerns . )\nDavid was on standard prescription medication for almost a year but experienced nasty side effects .\nThe drug therapy did not make much of an improvement with his tics , and it worsened his obsessive-compulsive tendencies considerably .\nHaldol left him \u201c zombified , \u201d with no motivation .\nEventually , it resulted in a drug-induced psychosis , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment he received in the hospital included more medications , including Luvox ( an antidepressant ) and Zyprexa ( an atypical antipsychotic ) .\nThings went from bad to horrifying .\nWhen I suggested it was the Haldol that was making him psychotic , they treated me like an ignorant hysterical person .\nBut I had already started reading Peter Breggin \u2019 s book Your Drug May Be Your Problem .\nWhen they released David back into my care , I started taking him to Dr. Tanya Murphy at Shands Clinic in Gainesville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PANDAS evaluation ( it was negative ) .\nBut her team also helped wean him off the medications .\nMeanwhile , I had to withdraw him from school .\nOne day I went to visit a friend who did art therapy for terminally-ill patients .\nShe had a print copy of the Latitudes newsletter on her table , and the rest is history .\n( Latitudes is now online-only . )\nAfter reading the first issue , for the first time I had hope that we would find help .\nI will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latitudes newsletters gave me .\nIn fact , out of gratitude , I remain a member of Latitudes.org to support it , even though we no longer need it for ourselves .\nI share the website and director Sheila DeMare \u2019 s books whenever I can .\nWe began natural therapies that I truly believed saved his life\u2013no hyperbole !\nWe saw an integrative medical doctor who was trained conventionally but specialized in natural medicine .\nShe and her team worked together on my son \u2019 s testing and treatment .\nNo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn what was actually causing David \u2019 s imbalances .\nThe whole process was a real eye-opener and made so much sense .\nOne of his doctors found David had high mercury levels , and efforts began to detoxify him from heavy metals .\nWe relied mostly on a chlorella supplement , followed by the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid .\nDuring this time , he was also seeing an excellent acupuncture therapist specializing in other natural therapies like reflexology , Chinese cupping detox , and biofeedback resonance therapy .\nNotably , a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his digestive tract .\nI understand this is not a unique finding , with many families and integrative practitioners reporting the same .\nIn my son \u2019 s case , we found Candida Clear by the supplement company NOW to effectively eradicate the candida .\n( The product contains herbs and caprylic acid , a fatty acid . )\nHe was also on a protocol of vitamins , minerals , and amino acids approved by his doctor .\nOf these , I always suspected that magnesium seemed the most effective in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection , I also found Epsom salt baths were beneficial .\nFor years , David had a bath most evenings with 2 cups Epsom salts in a tub of warm water and approximately a 20-minute soak .\nHe drank cupfuls of pure water or chamomile tea while in the tub , too .\nHe used Epsom salt foot baths and sometimes soaked a washcloth in a strong Epsom solution and applied it to troublesome tic areas on his body .\nHe told me this brought relief .\nThe efforts described above greatly improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food-related and environmental triggers through trial and error .\nThese could aggravate or trigger David \u2019 s tics and OCD behaviors .\nWe learned that foods with these items could increase David \u2019 s tics .\nThe degree of response seemed to depend on his overall health , stress level , energy , other exposures , etc .\n\u2022 Artificial sweeteners like Nutrasweet ( also known as aspartame ) and Splenda ( sucralose ) We had allergy tests conducted and did a process of food elimination to rule out any food allergies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any natural food allergies per se , though he does have a mild peanut sensitivity .\nI \u2019 m aware that some people are allergic to or have sensitivities to any number of foods like dairy , wheat ( gluten ) , corn , tomato , banana , or beef , etc.\n, and reactions to these can aggravate tics .\nI \u2019 ve read that the list of potential food triggers others have reported is wide-ranging and depends on the individual .\nMy son was able to identify other tic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his observations .\nThese included chlorine ( he avoids swimming pools now ) and most strong smells , like perfumes , household cleaners , and air fresheners .\nHe also reacts negatively to dust mites and mold exposure .\nSome years later , we saw an excellent allergist who ran extensive tests and diagnosed David with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity , which helped explain much of his extreme reactivity , including to the many chemicals used to make conventional pharmaceuticals !\nAs mentioned before , David showed hypersensitivity to sensory items related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , and sounds from a young age .\nWe enrolled him in specialized occupational therapy at age 9 for six months , and that helped reduce the extent of his sensitivities .\nWe learned techniques like skin brushing and other helpful skills to assist in reducing his hypersensitivity .\nI \u2019 ve heard from many folks with Tourette \u2019 s who complain of sensory factors or who have a diagnosis of Sensory Integration Dysfunction .\nThat said , even though he is doing very well now , David still removes all labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears his sox inside out because the seams drive him nuts !\nAcupuncture has been a help to David , as has reflexology and biofeedback .\nHe has also seen a chiropractor specializing in upper cervical chiropractic work ( see www.nucca.org ) .\nThis practitioner used gentle pressure methods to help re-align David \u2019 s neck and upper spine area .\nTiccing of the head , neck , shoulders , etc.\n, can result in skeletal misalignment .\nMisalignments , in turn , can lead to painful neuromuscular problems that we found could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive behavioral therapy for the

\u2019 m going to keep this as simple as can be .\nMuch will be repetition from what you may have already learned .\nSome will be new .\nAlong with all of the necessary personal and social behaviors being promoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth considering some of the research that may have relevance to the current situation .\nI \u2019 ve also provided plentiful scientific references for those who would like to delve more deeply .\nThis article focuses on naturopathic considerations .\nIn the next article I \u2019 ll be discussing what \u2019 s been going on in the homeopathy world around Covid-19 and the homeopathic experience in past epidemics .\nJust yesterday I learned that my nephew was ill with what has been confirmed to be Covid-19 .\nHe has a wife and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToday I spoke with him and questioned him in detail regarding his experience , and believe me , none of us would want to go through it .\nI then spoke with his wife and reviewed all the measures she is employing to help herself and this was a great discussion .\nNotably , a number of his work colleagues are ill but have not been tested , which tells us that the true count is well ahead of what is reported .\nThis also illustrates in several ways the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who is infected until they have isolated long enough to pass through the incubation stage , which can go all the way to three weeks .\nPeople feeling fine could be vectors of infection , as could their co-workers or family , so we have to avoid a false sense of security .\nControl freaks are having a huge healing right now as they finally realize we don \u2019 t control much and finally let it go .\nNevertheless , we can , with an effort of will , control our behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulent ( which essentially means harmful ) organism .\nSo it is easily transmitted and easily able to do its dirty work .\nIn the process of infection , once the virus attaches to a cell and then enters , it develops by activating a specific factor in the cellular fluid called an NLRP3 inflammasome .\nYou don \u2019 t have to remember NLRP3 .\nIn act , forget I even said it .\nThe important point is that this inflammasome activates the release of a complex family of immune factors known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness caused by Covid-19 .\nBy now you may have heard the term \u201c cytokine storm \u201d , which refers to an immune system gone wild .\nCytokines are a normal part of the immune system , though under various circumstances they can trigger severe local inflammation , as in rheumatoid arthritis .\nA Cytokine Storm is when too many cytokines are released too quickly , leading to fever , inflammation , and the array of symptoms associated with the illness .\nOf course , there are various other intriguing biochemical points around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular environment , but enough , as they say , is enough .\nThe severity of the infection depends on two main factors .\nFirst is the basic health status of the individual .\nThis includes any underlying conditions , the ways in which medications effect immune function , as well as nutritional status .\nStress is another risk factor as it has so many harmful effects on the body , including increasing inflammation and depressing immune function .\nSo chill out , get enough rest , breathe deeply , and learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportune time .\nThe second basic risk factor is age , as many of the most potent defensive and restorative systems within the body are less efficient with age .\nAge-related health issues such as cardiovascular or respiratory illness , and all of the other wide-ranging biological changes that go along with aging , can be a dangerous combination .\nI happen to be sensitive to this subject as I qualify for a pension this summer !\nSo in our review of research with some potential relevance , we have tried to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increase the immune systems ability to kill viruses , prevent viruses from attaching to cells , prevent viral replication within the cell , or reduce the activation of inflammasomes and other cellular factors that lead to serious illness .\nOne of the most interesting things I have learned though , is that virtually everything that has relevance to preventing viral infection , is also relevant to cancer prevention .\nI have nothing more to say about that here , but wanted to share that finding .\nA clear conclusion from all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food diet , rich in variety and color , is your first , most important line of defense .\nEven the elements that give foods their color are potent , antioxidant .\nand anti-inflammatory nutrients .\nSome have been shown to reduce inflammasome signals that can lead to a cascade of inflammatory factors .\nSo eat plenty of fresh vegetables , fruits , berries , nuts and seeds .\nI would particularly mention broccoli sprouts due to their rich content of sulforaphanes , though broccoli , cauliflower , cabbage , and kale are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current novel coronavirus is activated by an enzyme called TMPRSS2 .\nSulforaphanes , besides dampening inflammation , directly inhibit this enzyme .\nGreen tea catechins also inhibit the secretion of TMPRSS2 .\nAlso legumes , i.e.\n, beans , as well as grains such as millet , buckwheat , quinoa , and rice are all rich sources of macro and micro nutrients as well as a wide variety of phytochemicals , unique plant chemicals with health promoting and anti-aging value .\nIn fact , inadequate nutrient status is a major risk factor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a high quality multi-vitamin/multi mineral supplement .\nThere are various micronutrients that help maintain strong immune function , such as zinc and selenium .\nDiet alone can be insufficient and a general supplement can ensure that you \u2019 re covered .\nI would not recommend garden variety drug store formulas such as Centrum , as the quality of the nutrients and secondary ingredients are much less in tune with our natural physiology .\nBetter to consider natural food stores or natural health professionals .\nThe typical natural food store customer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard , therefore the companies are more competitive and produce better products to impress the market .\nThis is useful because the form of a nutrient that you take can make a big difference in assimilation and utilization .\nI was sent an audio by six people on the same day of a woman with an Aussie accent claiming to be giving advice from a Spanish doctor .\nIt wasn \u2019 t all that credible to me but she spoke about gargling , so I did a little research on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gargling with green tea or salt water can be a very useful factor in lowering the risk of viral infection .\nDrinking green tea also has important benefits due to the potent green tea catechins .\nPlease note that these suggestions are provided with the understanding that individual needs may vary ; no protocol can apply to everyone .\nAlso , breastfeeding mothers should consult with a knowledgeable practitioner for supplementation .\nVitamin C \u2013 1-2 grams three times daily with meals .\nFor kids above three years of age , 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well more than would normally be needed .\nVitamin C inhibits inflammasome activation and improves the outcome of upper respiratory infections .\nFor a variety of reasons , metabolic requirements go up significantly with infection , so double or even triple your dose if you become ill .\nSome hospitals are using IV infusions .\nVitamin D \u2013 5000 IU daily with meals .\nFor children aged one and above , 400 to 1000 is adequate , the higher range being appropriate to regions with less sun .\nThis is a preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the immune system is significant .\nVitamin D supplementation is important generally as vitamin D deficiency is quite common in northern climates .\nZinc \u2013 20 to 25 mg daily for adults .\nChildren from infancy to three years 3 \u2013 5 mg ; for growing children around 10 mg. is adequate through to the late teens .\nZinc is one of our top anti-viral and immune support nutrients .\nIt improves the function of white blood cells , an essential aspect of our immune defense and prevents the entry of viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess cytokine production .\nN-acetyl Cysteine \u2013 500 mg twice daily .\nThis nutrient increases levels of glutathione , the body \u2019 s master antioxidant .\nIt protects the energy engine of the cell , as well as various organ systems .\nIt improves mucous clearance in the lungs , improves lung function , and helps protect against lung damage .\nIt also disrupts bacterial communities called biofilms .\nQuercetin \u2013 Quercetin is a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables , and is particularly rich in apples and onions , particularly onion skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye and the pigment itself is the quercetin .\nSimply pour boiling water over onion skins and allow it to sit for thirty minutes , strain then drink it .\nAdd a little miso and voila !\nI \u2019 m not saying you should do this , I \u2019 m saying you could do this but , to make a long story short , if its not organic , don \u2019 t bother !\nAbsorption of quercetin from onions is twice that of tea and three times that of apples .\nQuercetin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current situation , it inhibits the ability of viruses to establish an infection through several mechanisms including preventing their entry into cells and reducing replication of the viruses that do enter .\nTo achieve benefits , supplemental doses of about 500 mg twice daily with meals are required .\nMelatonin \u2013 Melatonin is not just for sleep .\nNo , no , no !\nYes , it can give you wild dreams .\nYes , yes , yes !\nMelatonin is a potent inhibitor of NLPR3 ( oops ! )\ninflammasones , helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s energy engine , the mitochondria , is antioxidant , and lowers the production of

Parents should tell kids to wash their hands as always , and everything else would be \u201c business as usual until further notice.\n\u201d Well , further notice is here and business as usual\u2014as we are sheltering at home , stores closed , trying to figure out groceries , distance work , and how to make face masks out of old t-shirt sleeves that we aren \u2019 t already using in place of paper

quarantined back at school .\nMeanwhile , more and more students are feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends , coaches , and family members who have the virus .\nHow can they focus on math facts or chemistry
