, extreme social distancing , hand-washing , or any other emergency public health measures , other than the annual flu shot , which is said to be the only thing we need to protect ourselves , despite

year , notably in winter , consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weakness , muscle aches , URI symptoms , and/or GI upset , and linked to an array of familiar viruses , including influenzas , coronaviruses , and others , as well as a definite risk of complicating bacterial and viral pneumonias , with tens of thousands of deaths in the US alone , according to the CDC .\nBy Richard Moskowitz MD Hunkered down at

led up to it , and where we may be headed with it .\nThey fall into two general categories : first , it 's the real thing , not a hoax ; and second , there are plans to make long-term use of it in ways that are both seriously unhealthy and unacceptably repressive .\nSo far , it has spread to all continents and many if not most countries around the world , most rapidly in developed countries with large , crowded urban centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregate , and particularly among the elderly and the chronically ill , which has led to some uncertainty about how to define and properly calculate the death rate .\nIn Northern Italy , for example , its unusually large proportion of old people has led a number of epidemiologists to distinguish between those dying with the virus and those dying from or because of it , even though the virus was clearly implicated to some degree in both .\nA similar ambiguity confuses our reporting of flu deaths , which typically includes those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nIn any case , COVID-19 clearly qualifies as a pandemic , having spread widely and rapidly throughout the globe .\nAt the moment , the United States has become the epicenter of the outbreak , with the largest number of confirmed cases of any country so far , even as it appears to be receding in places that were maximally threatened before , like China , Italy , and Iran .\nWhen the COVID-19 illness was first identified in January , the CDC seemed relatively unconcerned about it , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat it posed to us , although we have since found out that he tried and failed buy the exclusive rights to the WHO-approved test kit from the German company that developed it , and then retaliated against them -- and us -- by refusing to order it from them when the virus went global .\nAs we saw , the resulting scarcity of test kits made it impossible to identify the asymptomatic and mildly ill cases , and thus contain the spread of the virus in its early phase , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases and might have been stopped in its tracks .\nAbove all , the lack of organized , competent , and closely co\u00f6rdinated leadership at the national level has left states , municipalities , health centers , and individuals having to fend for themselves , which they have done quite splendidly and even heroically on the whole , with some notable exceptions .\nIn any case , we soon learned that the best we could hope for was `` mitigation , '' i.e.\n, slowing rather than arresting its spread , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing from neighbors , handwashing , wiping down surfaces , and the like , which immediately led to panic buying of toilet paper , handiwipes , hand sanitizers , masks , and some food staples , followed by their disappearance from store shelves .\nIn rapid succession , the implementation of these measures then caused most non-emergency economic activity to grind to a halt , with closure of non-essential businesses , massive layoffs and loss of income , food shortages , widespread panic , and the dramatic plunging of the stock market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took office , a ratings catastrophe which finally commandeered his attention to the extent of his grudging acceptance of the CDC 's belated emergency measures .\nMeanwhile , as the dramatic rise in confirmed cases threatens to outrun the availability of inpatient beds and ICU 's , the lack of ventilators , masks , and protective garments has put doctors , nurses , and healthcare workers at high risk , such that many hospitals and clinics already are or may soon become short-staffed , while the continuing lack of adequate testing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are sick , have prevented any accurate measurement of the death rate and the actual trajectory of the outbreak .\nAs more tests become available , and more cases are discovered , we still do n't know for sure whether and how far along we are on the upside or downside of the curve ; and the more successful we are in slowing the spread and flattening the curve , the longer our emergency measures will have to last , since we wo n't know for sure that the outbreak is receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fewer and fewer are confirmed to be infected , which will clearly require many months at least , during which time many more thousands will fall ill and die .\n\u2022 Beware of the long-term agenda that 's likely to follow it .\nImmunization Agenda 2030 envisions a world where everyone , everywhere , at every age , fully benefits from vaccines to improve health and well-being .\n-- WHO Prospectus In recent years , the regular , predictable threat of seasonal flu-type viruses has been further exacerbated by the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies in Congress to defund and downsize the Federal civil service and the career professionals who staff its various agencies .\nIn lieu of its traditional priorities of promoting good sanitation and protecting the environment from toxic products in our air , water , soil , food , and livestock , most of what 's left of our public health infrastructure is packed into an originally independent agency , the CDC , which was created to oversee and regulate the health care system , especially the drug industry , but has become little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry .\nEspecially keen on promoting vaccines as their minimalist , cost-effective strategy for preventing infectious diseases , and , more recently , chronic diseases as well , the CDC , in addition to owning and profiting from a considerable number of them , promotes vaccines by rubber-stamping the industry 's safety and efficacy trials , and appointing top industry executives to its advisory committees , while the industry returns the favor by offering CDC officials six-figure salaries and generous stock options to occupy those same executive positions .\nThey 've even managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upheld by the Supreme Court that absolves them of any legal or financial liability for the deaths and serious injuries that they cause , a free ride granted to no other industry .\nLong before Trump was elected , more and more vaccines were manufactured , promoted , and eventually mandated for children ; and the mounting outcry of more and more parents with vaccine-injured sons and daughters motivated both industry and the CDC to urge states to enforce their mandates ever more strictly , in order to vaccinate as many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a small measles outbreak in 2016 spread from Disneyland visitors back to their home states , and again in 2019 , when the CDC sounded the alarm over a larger-than-usual but still modest outbreak of measles nationwide , a carefully-orchestrated hysteria in the news media persuaded several states to pass stricter laws eliminating all non-medical exemptions , despite massive protests that continue to this day .\nIn October of 2019 , this agitation provided the backdrop for a closed , unpublicized meeting in New York , organized by the Johns Hopkins Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , bringing together top executives and officials from CDC , the CIA , UPS , and various banks , hotels , airlines , drug companies , and news media .\nDrawing on the lingering memory of SARS , MERS , and the emergence of this new group of viruses in recent years , the organizers invited the participants to envision a massive coronavirus pandemic of global proportions , and to imagine what life would be like in the grip of it , a scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the one that the Gates Foundation has been prophesying and warning us about for the past year or so , and the actual plague we are now living through .\nThey further stipulated that it would cause 65,000,000 deaths , and that the world economy would collapse as a result of it , with enduring effects that would last for many years , including massive disinformation and the imposition of widespread censorship to combat it .\nFinally , they theorized that it would last 18 months , and end only when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80-90 % of the world population had been exposed to it , at which point it would presumably evolve into yet another endemic childhood disease , like the measles and other infections that we already vaccinate against .\nJust two months later , as if right on cue , the first confirmed case of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan , China ; and just two weeks after that , the World Economic Forum reconvened in Switzerland , together with the Director-General of WHO and many of the same participants as in New York .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation , a vaccine-making affiliate of the Gates Foundation , held a press conference to announce a global consortium for developing a vaccine against the virus as quickly as possible , yet another striking coincidence leading more than a few to speculate that they were already hard at work on it to get a leg up on the fierce competition that was sure to follow .\nSeveral days later , the WHO publicly declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic and global health emergency ; and before long they officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the New York organizers had dreamed up , with the vaccine arriving on the scene as the deliverance that by then we 'll all presumably be praying for .\nEven before the COVID-19 outbreak , the EU had been considering stricter enforcement of its own vaccine mandates , following massive demonstrations in the streets of Italy and France protesting the drastic loss of civil liberties that their existing laws would impose .\nTheir latest proposals involve tracking personal data in order to deny driver 's licenses and passports to any citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe COVID-19 emergency has heightened the threat and controversy surrounding these issues still further , as in Denmark , where the legislature unanimously passed a resolution giving the government absolute power to enforce any public health measures deemed necessary to combat the outbreak , including quarantine and mass vaccination when it becomes available .\nIn the United States , likewise , with the CDC predicting a death toll in the hundreds of thousands , the twin prospects of emergency measures continuing for many months , and of the same or mutant strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present outbreak has receded , might well provide the necessary conditions for the government and public health authorities to recommend and enact a new mandate for the coronavirus vaccine when it is thought ready , and to use our personal data to enforce it , with no exemptions of any kind , which would probably convince most people , including more than few who have opposed routine vaccine mandates in the past , to accept and indeed welcome this one , if not eventually relax their opposition to the others as well .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ has provided the CDC , the WHO , and the drug industry with the perfect opportunity to achieve their long-standing agenda of vaccinating everybody with everything , and of owning the personal data of every American to use for whatever doubtless worthy purpose they deem necessary or expedient , including the introduction of future vaccines now in the pipeline .\nThe first COVID-19 vaccine is already being tested on human volunteers without the preliminary animal trials that most epidemiologists insist upon .\nEven more alarming is the radically new strategy that it introduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or IGT , which has never before been tested or used in humans at all .\nInstead of introducing the virus into the blood and stimulating the immune system to make antibodies against it , like all other vaccines now in use , IGT delivers synthetic new genetic material that has been bioengineered to be resistant to the coronavirus and is then incorporated into the DNA or RNA of the host ; it bioengineers our response to the virus , rather than the virus itself , by altering the genetic structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept this vaccine , with or without the others , may still balk at having some doubtless well-meaning hotshot monkeying around with their genes .\nNor is it by any means a trifling matter , even to those reconciled to the idea , to give the government unlimited access to our personal information in order to enforce it , a power rightly associated with police states , like Nazi Germany or Putin 's Russia .\nTo which the only possible answer is , our government already has it , and has been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning and Edward Snowden have shown .\nAnd even if we were to accept this intrusion as necessary to deal with this genuine public health emergency , most people in their right mind would oppose its being used on a permanent or routine basis , and would rightly suspect that our government , or indeed any government , once given access to it , will want to hold onto it once the emergency is over , and perhaps prolong the emergency long enough for the public to learn to accept it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fear , beyond even what I know to be the downside of vaccination , which by now you 're most likely tired of hearing me harangue about .\nDr. Moskowitz is a Family physician , semi-retired , living

''\nSchool districts are also concerned about meeting timelines in the law to review students ' Individualized Education Programs , or IEPs , which outline their agreements for meeting individual students ' needs .\nSome schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student required special education services before the closures are now struggling to complete those processes before the deadlines in the law , Pudelski said .\nThat 's because paper forms are locked in schools put off limits by local health officials or because therapists ca n't meet with students to complete specific evaluations that may require the use of manipulatives or physical interaction .\nOn a much broader scale , some large districts are concerned they do n't have the capacity to update the IEPs of all already identified students to reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the supports they may have had access to at school .\n`` The clock does n't stop when schools are providing services as they are now , even though they are physically closed , '' Pudelski said .\n`` But there are numerous examples of why it 's unreasonable to expect them to meet all the different timelines in the law .\nThat 's why we recommend a pause until we are back to providing direct , in-person instruction to kids .

COVID 19 , the CDC \u2019 s official autism rate keeps rising , up 10 % from 2006 to 2008 birth years View a 12 Powerpoint Presentation here : 1 in 54 born in 2008 by Mark Blaxill .\nEach slide also follows at the end of this post .\nEvery two years , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) puts out a new report from its Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ( ADDM ) Network .\nThe 2016 report , a survey of 11 states , was just released and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per 10,000 among 8-year-old children born in 2008 , or 1 in 54 .\nThat rate was an increase over the 2014 ADDM Network report , which reported a rate of 1 in 59 .\nI \u2019 ve summarized the new reports findings in the attached slides ( see HERE ) .\nNestled within the report \u2019 s detail are a number of disturbing findings \u2022 New Jersey , one the ADDM Network \u2019 s most experienced and consistent reporting sites , reported an autism rate of 3.14 % , or in 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere \u2022 Among young boys born in NJ in 2008 , the autism rate reached 5 % , or 1 in 20 boys \u2022 Overall rates rose despite actual declines in 4 of 11 reporting states like Minnesota , Maryland , Missouri and Colorado .\n\u2022 The overall autism rate in boys rose to 1 in 34 from 1 in 38 .\n\u2022 This ongoing explosion in autism rates is echoed by similar increases in rates from the National Survey of Childhood Health ( NSCH ) , which has reported rates of 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 36 : ASD Rate Set a New Record High in 2016 ) .\nAll of this news will be lost as the report has been released in the midst of the COVID 19 panic .\nIt \u2019 s always dangerous to compare public health crises , but consider this .\nIf instead of raising the threat of death among the elderly for a few short months , some new but different coronavirus permanently disabled close to 3 % of American children in a pandemic fashion , how do you think our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the public health response would be even more aggressive than today \u2019 s COVID 19 response .\nBut because the autism epidemic has been normalized , these new findings will pass by almost entirely unnoticed .\nInstead , the CDC not only continues its practice of autism epidemic denial , it has downgraded its concern .\nIn the 2014 ADDM report , a sentence buried deep in the text acknowledged that autism was \u201c an urgent public health concern.\n\u201d In today \u2019 s release , an autism rate of 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health concern.\n\u201d And instead of raising the alarm over their unbending trend line , the CDC reserves its main concerns for racial equality : applauding the fact that autism in African Americans is now broadly similar to that of white and Asian Americans .\n\u201c Overall , the magnitude of prevalence differences by race and ethnicity has declined in recent year .\nReduction of these disparities might indicate progress toward enhanced detection of ASD among all children.\n\u201d This is all a part of CDC \u2019 s ongoing to a commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of the reality of the evidence on autism time trends .\nAll in the interest of their self-congratulatory talking points , which persistently claim that if autism rates are rising , well then they must be doing a better job !\nFrom their Frequently Asked Questions page , we can still see the following pabulum Q : Is there an ASD epidemic ?\nA : More people than ever before are being diagnosed with an ASD .\nIt is unclear exactly how much of this increase is due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diagnosis .\nHowever , a true increase in the number of people with an ASD can not be ruled out .\nWe believe the increase in the diagnosis of ASD is likely due to a combination of these factors .\nCDC is working with partners to study the prevalence of ASD over time , so that we can find out if the number of children with these disorders is rising , dropping , or staying the same .\nWe do know that ASD are more common than we thought before and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI wrote at greater length on this several years ago .\n( see Mark Blaxill : Lies , Damned Lies and CDC Autism Statistics ) .\nHow truly tragic how little things have

.\nMarcia : \u201c Hearing that your child has autism is kind of terrifying .\nI don \u2019 t want any other parent to feel as terrified as I did .\nRyan , he was very serious .\nIn the beginning all he wanted to do\u2014he had this little portable radio , and he would take it to every outlet and plug it in and out , over and over and over again .\nI asked Marcia about her son Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy I talked to Marcia on Skype so everyone can hear her story and know we should never give up on our kids .\nThis is her account of successfully recovering her son Ryan from autism .\nPreview Ryan \u2019 s recovery story on Amazon or Marcia \u2019 s website .\nCheck out this 90 sec clip from the documentary Restoring Balance : Autism Recovery that shows Marcia \u2019 s son before and after interventions .\n( watch here ) Ryan \u2019 s mom just wants all kids to have what her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the book go to autism treatments/research and Marcia never charges for helping families .\nOnce it becomes common knowledge that autism is the result of a dysfunctional immune system and is TREATABLE more answers and research will come .\nBy Anne Dachel I recently got to know a tremendous activist in the autism community , Marcia Hinds .\nShe \u2019 s the author of the book , I Know You 're in There : Winning Our War Against Autism , published in January , 2020 .\n\u201c He couldn \u2019 t speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the third percentile for speech , and had no functional speech at all .\n\u201c I was told there was nothing I could do , he \u2019 d never get better , and you might as well hang it up .\n\u201c The person who diagnosed him said to me , \u2018 There \u2019 s no hope .\nThere \u2019 s nothing you can do .\nThis kid \u2019 s not going to be okay .\nMost of these kids end up in an institution or in jail.\n\u2019 That \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told us about his autism .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t believe\u2014because he was diagnosed when he was almost four\u2014that she gave my son a life sentence at that moment .\nThat is so wrong .\nIt is so wrong.\n\u201d Marcia talked about how the medical community fails to address the biomedical issues in autism , and how she was left on her own to help recover her son \u201c I think that the medical profession still believes what they learned in medical school when they got Autism 101\u2014that autism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing you can do .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of interesting because my son only began to make significant progress after we abandoned the idea that this was a developmental or psychiatric disorder and started to treat his broken immune system .\n\u201c What \u2019 s wrong with our kids is that they have too many stressors on their immune systems , and it \u2019 s not just one thing that causes it , it \u2019 s multiple things .\nAnd that \u2019 s what makes it so hard to treat because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that our wrong with their bodies .\nOnce you do that , that \u2019 s when they can start to learn what they couldn \u2019 t before .\n\u201c Let me give you an example : when my son was little he used to bite and squeeze his older sister\u2014she was three years older than him\u2014until she cried .\n\u201c And she \u2019 d say to me , \u2018 Mom , can I hit him ?\n\u2019 \u2014and I \u2019 d say to her , \u2018 Meg , when he \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It \u2019 s still a big joke between them today because whenever he ticks her off , she hauls off and just slugs him .\nThen they both start laughing .\n\u201c No matter what I did , I could not teach this kid to not hit , or bite , or squeeze his older sister .\n\u201c You have to understand [ that ] my husband and I as undergraduates , before we had Ryan , we were both behavior therapists under Dr , Ivar Lovaas at UCLA .\nWe knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still couldn \u2019 t get him to not do it .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until we started medical treatment\u2026 The medical term is a dysfunctional immune system .\nI call it a messed up immune system .\n\u201c Maybe if we started calling it that , the doctors would start doing the research and our kids would get the medical treatment they need and deserve .\nMarcia talked about her road to recovery with her son \u201c Today Ryan works as an aerospace engineer .\nHe has good friends , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first diagnosed , the experts said he would need to be institutionalized one day .\nThat is so devastating to a parent .\n\u201c They just don \u2019 t get it .\nThey really don \u2019 t get it .\nIt took me some time to realize that the real truth about autism is that once you help them medically , that \u2019 s when they \u2019 re able to learn what they couldn \u2019 t before .\n\u201c Now if we \u2019 d just done the medical without the behavioral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be okay .\nIf we had just done the ABA without the medical piece , Ryan wouldn \u2019 t be okay .\nIt takes all of it together .\nThe medical makes it so they can learn ; the behavioral and educational catches them up everything they missed .\n\u201c A lot of parents have this feeling like , \u2018 Oh my God , if my kid could just talk , everything would be okay.\n\u2019 That \u2019 s not true .\nYou have to remember it takes a normal child three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have anything wrong with their body .\nSo if you \u2019 re using speech to see if the medical \u2019 s working , that \u2019 s not a good indicator .\n\u201c Sometimes what our kids do is they pick up where they left off .\nFor my son , he probably stopped developing about age two .\nThen we started the medical treatments\u2026he was about five .\nAnd once he started to develop again , he started to develop as a two year old .\nTwo year old behavior doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old .\nIt looked like he was getting worse when he was actually getting better .\n\u201c Our kids are so hard to understand .\nIn this book that I wrote called I Know You \u2019 re in There : Winning Our War Against Autism -- it was a war .\nIt took everything I had to keep going , and sometimes I \u2019 d wake up , and I had nothing left .\nI \u2019 d work with the kid all day long\u2014back then we didn \u2019 t even have Internet\u2014so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\n\u201c I would work with Ryan all day long and I \u2019 d stay up all night reading .\nMy husband looked at me , and he \u2019 d say , \u2018 You can \u2019 t do this , \u2019 and I \u2019 d say to him , \u2018 I have to .\nThere \u2019 s nobody else who \u2019 s going to.\n\u2019 \u201c Sometimes parents wait for someone else to do this for you .\nNo one is going to do this for you .\nNobody wants your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever done , and it is so worth it , because today , Ryan is incredible.\n\u201d Marcia : \u201c That anger kept me going when I had nothing else \u201d \u201c I read a book called , Let Me Hear Your Voice , by Catherine Maurice .\nIt was the only book way back then that had anything positive to say about autism .\nThe first piece of help that I got was from Dr. Bernard Rimland .\nI called that Autism Research Institute , and he answered the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was because I was very green .\n\u201c I should have been really impressed , but I wasn \u2019 t because I didn \u2019 t know who he was .\nHe seemed like a nice old man who was trying to help me .\n\u201c He said to me , \u2018 Does Ryan do a lot of dairy ?\n\u2019 and I said , \u2018 Yeah.\n\u2019 And he goes , \u2018 Why don \u2019 t you try taking dairy away for a week and then give him a glass of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the kind of mom who gave my kids Fun Fruits for breakfast .\nI wasn \u2019 t into nutrition at all .\nWe had pizza all the time .\nIf he had said to me , \u2018 You need to go on a nondairy diet , \u2019 I would have said , \u2018 Okay , \u2019 and not have done it .\nBut the way he said it , because I was so desperate , and he was so kind , I tried it .\nI took him off dairy for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid was phenomenal .\nAnd after I did that , I never did give him that glass of milk because all of a sudden he was more tuned in , there were less noises , less stimming , he was just so much better .\n\u201c But that was only one piece of it .\nThere were so many other things we had to do .\nThis is not an easy fix .\nThere is not magic bullet out there , and I know that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all the little things together to make them better so they can learn .\n\u201c I want parents to realize [ that ] the best piece of advice I ever got was from the woman who wrote the book , Let Me Hear Your Voice , and that was Catherine Maurice .\nShe told me , \u2018 You have to use what your kids love to teach them.\n\u2019 \u201c Basically we did a modified ABA program .\nEvery lesson that I taught Ryan\u2026contained something that he loved or mostly obsessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators , keys , locks , cars , computers , light switches .\n\u201c The way my husband would get Ryan out of the house without me is he would say , \u2018 Ryan , do you want to go to the hardware store and look at the plugs and the switches ?\n\u2019 \u201c And they \u2019 d go to the hardware store , and then they \u2019 d plug all the switches together , and when no one was looking , they \u2019 d sneak out of the store .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to connect and make Ryan join our world .\nI always say that you have to make them join up to your world and not change the world for them .\nTo do that we used what Ryan loved .\n\u201c Sometimes we just wanted to scream because he talked about the same thing over and over and over again .\nHe wanted friends , but he didn \u2019 t know how to do it .\nHe \u2019 d go up to kids , and he \u2019 d poke \u2018 em and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEventually the social skills came , but that was the last thing to come and the hardest thing to teach .\n\u201c And it \u2019 s all in [ my ] book [ I Know You \u2019 re in There ] .\nThe book is the roadmap to what we did to help Ryan .\nIn there I talk about all the mistakes I made because I don \u2019 t want parents to waste any time and make the same stupid mistakes that I did .\nI tried a lot of crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you \u2019 ll do anything to help your kid .\n\u201c I just hope that parents remember that and use what they love to teach them .\n\u201c The one mistake that I never made was to give up .\nI made a lot of mistakes , but I kept putting one foot in front of the other no matter how hard it got .\nWhen I got too tired to keep going , I would imagine that day in the psychiatrist office who first gave us that diagnosis , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That anger kept me going when I had nothing else .\nIt was through the one-on-one work that things improved for Ryan \u201c Ryan got speech thirty minutes , twice a week .\nIt wouldn \u2019 t have been enough if that \u2019 s all we had done .\nI was really lucky in that the speech teachers did ABA naturally .\nThey were just good teachers .\nThey used what my son loved to motivate him and to teacher him .\n\u201c I would borrow their noun cards that had pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you use them for about a week .\n\u201c They would let me borrow them , and I would take out three pictures .\nI would have a picture of a house , and I would have a picture of a car , and I would have a picture of a pencil .\nI \u2019 d put them in front of me .\nI would say , \u2018 Car , \u2019 and I \u2019 d make him say , car .\nI \u2019 d say \u2018 house , \u2019 and I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I \u2019 d make him say , pencil .\n\u201c Then I \u2019 d say to him , \u2018 Ryan , close your eyes.\n\u2019 \u2026and I \u2019 d grab one of the cards and I \u2019 d say , \u2018 What \u2019 s missing ?\n\u2019 and he would have to tell me which card was missing .\nThen he got to be the teacher , and he \u2019 d do the same thing .\nAnd every time he got one right , he got a puzzle piece .\nRyan loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzle pieces , he got to put the puzzle together .\n\u201c That was the way I used what he loved to teach him .\n\u201c Sometimes with our kids it \u2019 s hard to figure out what motivates them , but there are things that motivate them .\nA lot of times it \u2019 s just they want everything to stay the same .\nThe sameness motivates them .\n\u201c When we would work together , we \u2019 d go into the playroom , and we had a whiteboard .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick an activity .\nWe \u2019 d write it all down on the whiteboard , so he knew what was coming when .\nAnd when we finished one , he \u2019 d come and erase it .\nSo we used all those things to motivate him .\nWhat \u2019 s really wrong with our kids \u201c I don \u2019 t think any of our kids have what we refer to as autism .\nI always call it , autoimmune encephalitis .\nThe reason I know that is because when Ryan was about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , UCLA , and he was given something called a NEUROspect .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a big , fancy test that measure blood flow to different areas of the brain .\nThe interesting part of doing that test was , the doctor who read it , who had never met my son , wrote , autism , question mark .\nquestion mark , question mark .\n\u201c If this was really a developmental or psychiatric disorder , how would he know by the blood flow in my son \u2019 s brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation in his brain kept different areas from getting the blood flow that they needed .\n\u201c When Ryan was about seven , maybe two , three years later , we repeated that same test .\nWhat happened was , the blood flow to the different areas of his brain was much improved and so was my son .\n\u201c That is proof that this is not really autism , but it \u2019 s really his autoimmune encephalitis.\n\u201d Email marcia @ autismandtreatment.com with your location for help finding the right doctor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @

educational records of 8-year-old children from 11 monitoring sites across the United States .\nOfficially one in every 59 children in the U.S. is on the autism spectrum .\nThat statistic has been out for two years and any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories below seem to indicate .\nStill , as in the past , more kids with autism is never a crisis .\nWe are about to enter April , Autism Awareness Month .\nAlthough significantly overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis , I \u2019 m already seeing the standard coverage about \u201c celebrating \u201d autism awareness .\nReally alarming was the rate from New Jersey in the 2018 CDC announcement : In that state one in every 34 children has autism , one in every 22 boys .\nNew Jersey is credited with having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so their identification of the disorder is considered very accurate .\nSTILL no one speculated that New Jersey \u2019 s numbers might be the real deal for the entire country .\nCurrently officials have neatly left us to expect even higher autism numbers , and news reports have set the stage .\nOn March 12 , 2020 , Disability Scoop announced that there \u2019 s been a \u201c steep rise in students with autism.\n\u201d The percentage of American schoolchildren receiving special education services as a result of an autism diagnosis doubled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Department of Education shows that 10.51 percent of all students with disabilities ages 6 to 21 in 2018 were identified as having autism .\nJust a decade earlier , that figure was at 4.97 percent\u2026 .\nAcross the nation , the percentage of students with disabilities who had autism varied by state , with a high of 15 percent in Minnesota during the 2018-2019 school year .\nBy comparison , only 5 percent of students with disabilities in Montana were on the spectrum at that time\u2026 .\nSo why is the percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to increase ?\nWe weren \u2019 t told .\nCuriously the Department of Education announcement didn \u2019 t get mainstream news coverage at all .\nOther findings by top experts showed even more reasons to worry that we \u2019 ll never see the end of autism increases .\nIt seems that doctors still are not finding all the kids with autism .\nBack in Jan 2020 we learned this from MedicalExpress : One-fourth of children with autism are undiagnosed .\nOne-fourth of children under age 8 with autism spectrum disorder\u2014most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is critical for improving quality of life .\nThe fidings , published in the journal Autism Research , show that despite growing awareness about autism , it is still under-diagnosed , particularly in black and Hispanic people , said study co-author Walter Zahorodny , an associate professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and director of the New Jersey Autism Study , which contributed to the research .\nResearchers analyzed the education and medical records of 266,000 children who were 8 years old in 2014 , seeking to determine how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not clinically diagnosed or receiving services .\nOf the nearly 4,500 children identified , 25 percent were not diagnosed .\nMost were black or Hispanic males with deficits in mental abilities , social skills and activities of daily living who were not considered disabled .\nAre we to understand that better diagnosing/greater awareness , long credited as the reason more and more kids have an autism label , hasn \u2019 t extended to black and Hispanic children ?\nAre we to expect a greater effort to find the minority kids with ASD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total ?\nWhile studies and findings are concerning , individual news reports should really have us worried .\nDisability Scoop : New research suggests that the prevalence of autism is on the rise and it \u2019 s growing at a significantly faster clip among certain groups of kids .\nBetween 2007 and 2013 , autism rates increased 73 percent among Hispanics and 44 percent among black children ages 3 to 5 .\nAt the same time , prevalence rose 25 percent for whites in that age bracket .\n\u2026 Traditionally , autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factor often attributed to a lack of awareness and resources in such communities .\nHowever , the new study found that prevalence among black children surpassed whites in 30 states by 2012 .\n\u201c These results suggest that additional factors beyond just catch-up may be involved , \u201d Nevison said .\nThe most recent figures from the CDC , which were released last year , indicate that 1 in 59 children have autism .\n\u2026 Since the start of the century , the government \u2019 s official estimate of autism prevalence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that autism prevalence has increased significantly over the past 10 to 20 years , and based on what we have seen from this larger , more recent dataset it will continue to increase among all race and ethnicity groups in the coming years , \u201d said Walter Zahorodny , an autism researcher at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who worked on the study .\nFacing a staggering 47 % increase in the number of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) students enrolled in its district since 2010 , Plymouth-Canton Community Schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country \u2014 is entrenched in a daily race to keep up with the complexities that accompany its rising special-needs population .\nFor all of the questions and dilemmas that accompany these complexities , there are few clear-cut answers , a decent share of resistance from families searching for the ideal programs for their children and a paperwork-coated strain on special-education teachers that administrators fear could lead to early burnout and system-crippling teacher shortages\u2026 .\nDifficult questions Among the most challenging dilemmas school districts confront throughout each ASD student 's educational career are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-tiered special education flow chart ?\n... On Feb 3 , 2020 a California education publication called Ed100 reported that special education costs were \u201c overwhelming \u201d school budgets .\nNearly 800,000 students in California receive special education services \u2014 about one in every eight students .\nAccording to 2019 estimates by the California Legislative Analyst Office ( LAO ) , the average annual cost of educating a student with disabilities \u2014 $ 27,000 \u2014 is almost triple the cost to educate a student without disabilities \u2014 about $ 10,000 .\nEd100 reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly \u201d over the past decade resulting in a 28 percent increase .\nAbout two-thirds of the cost increases reflect the growing number of students with severe disabilities , especially autism .\nWhy there is this growing number of students with severe disabilities/autism is anyone \u2019 s guess .\nMost of the article was devoted to discussing how the cost of special ed is handled and what the federal government requires .\nA story out on Mar 23 from Naperville , Illinois painted a really dismal picture of autism in America with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism diagnoses among children have \u201c climbed steadily over the past few decades , \u201d and the current rate \u201c is estimated at 1 in 40 children.\n\u201d In actual numbers , the article explained that the total of kids on the spectrum went from 93,000 in 2000 to over 617,000 by 2016 .\nAs schools deal with an increasing number of children with disabilities like autism , demand for disabilities awareness and sensitivity programs has increased , meaning Portland-based organization The Cromwell Center currently has a waiting list of 25 schools\u2026 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the school \u2019 s students have some type of disability\u2026 .\nLast year , there were almost 64,000 students with a diagnosed disability in Arkansas public schools .\nThat is 13.4 % of the state 's total student enrollment .\nArkansas school districts spent $ 458 million on special education services , or about $ 7,382 per pupil with a disability .\nIn the 2012-2013 school year , Arkansas schools spent $ 412 million on special education for 54,000 students .\nExcept for the category of children with multiple disabilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with autism growing the most over the past few years .\nThe number of students diagnosed with autism has gone up 55 % since 2013 .\nThe increase is attributable to an increased awareness among educators and others of the characteristics of autism .\nThe growth in children diagnosed with dyslexia has followed a similar trend .\nIn 2014 , for example , 957 students received therapy for dyslexia .\nIn 2014 , only 89 school districts and one charter school reported results from screening for dyslexia .\nSchool Superintendent Timothy F. Connellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year represents a 3.11 % increase over current spending levels .\nThe $ 101.6 million budget request would add new special education positions as school officials seek to expand the district 's autism program .\nIt also calls for a new language arts teacher , math specialist and registered nurse position .\nConnellan presented the budget to the school board Thursday night .\nThe overall request would increase spending by more than $ 3 million over the district 's current $ 98.8 million spending plan .\nMore than than $ 381,000 would fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connellan said special education is \u201c really driving \u201d the budget increases .\n\u2026 The new special education positions include a full-time teacher , seven full-time behavioral therapists and a half-time speech language pathologist in a proposed expansion of the school district 's program for students on the autism spectrum .\nConnellan said there has been a significant increase in the number of students on the autism spectrum .\nSchool department figures show that number has steadily increased in recent years .\nDuring the 2013-2014 school year , there were 90 students diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2018-2019 school year , the figure had risen to 123 .\nDiscussions on the budget request will continue next week , with public workshops scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday .\nBoard of Education member Robert S. Brown said he wants to be sure the public and other elected officials are aware of the increased population of autistic students .\n\u201c I think we need to clearly explain the numbers have increased so dramatically , \u201d he said .\nThroughout 2019 there were several high-profile warnings about stretched budgets in schools .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Westminster said a lack of money was having a devastating impact on schools\u2026 .\nIt said Northern Ireland had faced the highest school spending cuts per pupil in the UK over the past decade\u2026 .\nA number of parents also spoke out about the problems they had getting appropriate help for their children with autism and other special needs .\nThe proportion of children with autism in Northern Irish schools has almost trebled in a decade , according to the Department of Health .\n\u2026As the number of cases suffering from autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a recent study says how insufficient the supply of certified applied behaviour analysis ( ABA ) providers is to meet the needs of children with autism .\nThe study has found that there is substantial variation across states and regions .\nFor instance , the per capita supply of certified

the importance of access to evidence-based interventions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children had ASD in 2014 , up from one in 125 a decade earlier , according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\u2026 .\nIt \u2019 s the type of decision parents across the Central Valley are facing with increasing regularity , as autism diagnoses soar and parents seek classrooms with better options for their children .\nSpecial education enrollment has surged in the last decade , with more than 96,000 students pouring into school districts across the state , according to data from the California Department of Education .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in students with autism and other behavioral delays , a Bee analysis shows .\nAt the same time , the number of students with other disabilities grew modestly or decreased between the 2009 and 2018 school years .\nAlthough the trend is undeniable , no one can say exactly why it \u2019 s happening\u2026 .\n\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s the concentration of students within that number and that \u2019 s where it \u2019 s affected a lot of schools because services for students with autism can be very expensive.\n\u201d The increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery for years .\nAwareness has grown , experts say .\nTeachers are trained to recognize the disorder .\nAnd in 2013 , the medical definition of autism was changed , grouping a number of conditions like Asperger \u2019 s syndrome and pervasive development disorder under the umbrella of autism .\n\u201c The increase isn \u2019 t just in California but it is nationwide , probably worldwide , \u201d said Aubyn Stahmer , who oversees community treatment research at the MIND Institute .\n\u201c The diagnostic definitions have broadened a little bit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has really increased quite a bit.\n\u201d \u2026 In the Fresno Unified School District , special education accounts for about 14 percent of its budget .\nIn the last decade , state education data shows enrollment jumped by 6 percent but the share of students with autism climbed nearly three-fold .\nAs the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder continues to rise in the United States , the supply of certified applied behavior analysis providers to match the demand for treatment has fallen significantly short , according to study findings published in Psychiatric Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applied behavior analysis providers in nearly all states in the U.S. , \u201d Yidan Xue Zhang , MC , of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta , told Healio Psychiatry .\n\u201c We need to increase the supply of autism service providers to improve treatment access for children with autism.\n\u201d \u2026 Enrollment at the Learning Center in Manchester soon will grow to 36 students , the maximum number that can be served in the current space , Danielczuk said .\nShe and Goduti said there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school\u2026 .\nNationwide , 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with autism and the rate has grown steadily for the past 20 years , according to the National Autism Association .\nAlthough no two children on the spectrum are alike , boys are four times more likely to have autism than girls and about 40 percent of all diagnosed children do not speak .\nThat \u2019 s the story everywhere as there are lots more articles like these out there .\nWe have no national strategy to deal with this

respond to this .\nThe federal government isn \u2019 t ready for this .\nThe state government isn \u2019 t ready for this .\nThis is strange , and the question becomes WHY .\nWhy is it that government

.\n\u201c I think elected officials tend to live in information bubbles .\nThey tend to be surrounded by other people who look and think like them .\nThey tend to only talk to people who look and think like them .\nThey tend to listen to lobbyists who are in their ear and writing them checks .\nSo then a parent comes to testify or to meet with them to explain the vaccine injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t know what to do with this information .\nSo they dismiss it or they don \u2019 t want to think about it , or they find ways to distract themselves .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t quite know how things go astray with elected officials , but in the social science literature they say that knowledge is socially constructed .\nWe would like to think that we all just are governed by the facts , and that we all follow logic and reason .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

they think that if they catch COVID-19 , they have a high likelihood of dying from the disease .\nMost public health officials have done little to lessen this fear , arguing that people are ten times

these numbers in perspective , let \u2019 s look at countries that have dealt with COVID-19 .\nChina , where COVID-19 originated , has reported roughly 3,000 deaths .\nThe population of China is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ours .\nIf we suffer an equivalent proportion of deaths , then 1,000 Americans will die from COVID-19 , one-twentieth to one-fiftieth of the number who have died from influenza .\nItaly

of the U.S. population .\nIf we suffer an equivalent proportion of deaths , then 10,000 Americans will die of COVID-19 , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths from influenza .\nNot everyone , however , is at equal risk of dying .\nThe virus primarily kills the elderly and those suffering from chronic diseases , which explains the situation in Italy , where 25 percent of its population is more than 65 years of age ; in the U.S. it \u2019 s 16 percent .\nWouldn \u2019 t it make more sense , then , to ask people who are elderly and infirm to stay away from crowds , thus lessening their chances of

.\nIn response to a question from \u2018 Agenzia Nova \u2019 , in fact , Brusaferro was unable to indicate the exact number of coronavirus deaths .\nHowever , the professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed , the vast majority of the victims \u2018 had serious [ non-COV ] pathologies and in some cases the onset of an infection of the respiratory tract can lead more easily to death.\n\u2019 To clarify this point , and provide real data , \u2018 as we acquire the folders we will go further .\nHowever , the populations most at risk are fragile , carriers of multiple diseases \u2019 .\n\u201d Translation

D. When I first heard of the outbreak , my attention was fixed on the coincidence that it began in Wuhan , near the Chinese bioweapons lab , and the obvious speculation that the virus was manmade , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Trump Administration 's slow , reluctant , and utterly incompetent response to it has created an honest-to-God public health emergency that has quite rightly upstaged the absorbing mystery of where and how it originated .\nIn particular , the systematic defunding of our public health infrastructure and the inexcusable lack of testing materials that it helped bring about , when combined with the large proportion of people carrying the virus and thus contagious with very mild illness or no symptoms at all , have prevented any accurate measure of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actual death rate , which can be expected to decline once these mild and asymptomatic cases are identified and included in the tally .\nThis radical uncertainty has already eliminated the possibility of containing the outbreak ; the best we can do now is to mitigate its spread by slowing it down , lest it overwhelm our clinics and hospitals and available personnel to staff them .\nWhat seems virtually certain is that there will be a lot more cases once we begin testing on a wider scale .\nThe CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and should do to protect both ourselves and everybody else , namely , 1 ) avoiding large crowds , postponing unnecessary travel , and keeping a safe distance from those you 're in contact with ; 2 ) washing hands often with soap and water , and wiping off objects and surfaces in common use that you 've touched or grasped ; 3 ) remembering not to touch nose , mouth , and face with your hands except when necessary ; 4 ) limiting contact with the elderly and those weakened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 ) getting tested if you fall sick , covering nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough , and staying home if you test positive : all good , sensible precautions .\nIn addition , many physicians are recommending high doses of Vitamin C , say 3000 mg. daily for prophylaxis , and even more for the actual illness , with coughing and shortness of breath , at which point Dr. Brownstein suggests adding Vitamins A , D , and iodine as well .\nHomeopaths have had and continue to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellow fever , measles , influenza , and the like , using a simple method that deserves much wider recognition and use .\nOnce about 20 or 25 cases have been investigated , one remedy will be found to fit around 75 % of the cases , and is therefore designated as the basic remedy or genus epidemicus of the outbreak .\nIt can then be given out prophylactically to people who are not yet sick , whether in the vicinity or recently exposed , and also to early cases .\nMore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the US , too few cases have been seen and treated homeopathically to identify the main remedy ; but colleagues in Hong Kong and Taiwan have had the most success with Gelsemium , followed by Bryonia and Eupatorium perfoliatum in advanced cases with their typical indications .\nFor prophylaxis , they therefore recommend Gelsemium 30C once a week in towns , rural areas , and neighborhoods far from those most seriously affected ;

''\n, which aims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revising current beliefs about the effectiveness ) of measles vaccinations in the light of the latest `` epidemics '' found or declared in Europe and the USA .\nThe article contains facts and deductions that demonstrate the bad faith of the whole propaganda operation underpinning global vaccination programs .\nIn practice , many of the doubts that parents have when they critically consider whether to have their children administered vaccines are justified .\nThe doyen of vaccinology certifies in black and white the same issues that parents who are against compulsory vaccination are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us move on to the points .\nIt turns out that : 1 ) It is not possible to rely on the antibody titer that has so far been deemed appropriate to confer immunity .\nMore precisely , \u201c the fully protective level of neutralizing antibodies is not known '' .\nAn article was published on November 1 , 2019 which was to say the least explosive [ 1 ] , that strangely enough has nevertheless gone under the radar : no one is talking about it , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents is remarkable .\nHowever , rumors tell us that the World Health Organization would be rather worried about these black-and-white admissions that unequivocally certify those problems that have been reported for a long time - on the one hand by doctors , epidemiologists and researchers an on the other hand , by a large slice of the population that questions the enforced expansion of vaccination practice today .\nFirst of all , the weight of these considerations is considerable because of the author : we are not talking about just any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley A. Plotkin , regarded for all intents and purposes as `` the father of world vaccinology `` - author of the book `` Vaccines '' [ 2 ] which is the reference text with regard to vaccinations in general .\n\u201c However , the vaccine gives an attenuated infection , and it is not the case that antibody levels remain permanently elevated in vaccinees .\nThe current situation is responsible for reevaluation of the long-term efficacy of measles vaccine '' ( Plotkin ) So what are we supposed to do ?\nVaccinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even knowing when and to what extent you will be protected ?\nAnd what consequences could this have on the immune system ?\n3 ) We have no idea exactly how antibody protection works , what the role of antibodies or the role of cells themselves in providing protection at various levels against infections .\nIt goes without saying that if we are not sure how these immune processes work , it will be impossible to talk with certainty about the effectiveness of vaccines ...\nIf we do not know these mechanisms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation to vaccinate everyone and pretend that there is no doubt about it ?\n4 ) As if that were not enough , it is finally admitted that , since vaccinated do not appear to be immune to the new viruses currently circulating ( !\n!\n! )\nHave these new genotypes always existed or are they `` off-spring \u201d of massive vaccination campaigns against genotype A ?\nThe answer already exists : it is well known how viruses have the ability to mutate , especially under conditions of selective pressure ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vaccination campaigns ) , and it is for this reason that talking about the eradication of \u201d measles `` is a colossal mockery .\nWhy are we vaccinating billions of people against a genotype that is probably no longer the main culprit of epidemics ?\nBut most importantly : why do not genotyping proceed on all subjects who are diagnosed with the disease ?\nIs the purpose of immunisation and health protection , or is it to vaccinate everyone regardless of the need or effectiveness of this intervention ?\n5 ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus !\n!\n!\nThis admission is epochal .\nFor years it was denied ( without proof ) that this could happen , snubbing research that demonstrated the presence of the virus vaccine in the oropharynx and in the urine of vaccinated , relegating to \u201c non-contagious measles \u201d events exanthematic in the vaccinated ( and continuing to load the blame purely on the unvaccinated ) , and now , before our ears , as it turns out , is - and always was - a risk that is real and plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just vaccinated !\nPlotkin writes \u201c the possibility that a subclinical infection or a few symptoms with measles virus occurs between vaccinated people should be taken into account .\nAlthough I am not aware of evidence on the excretion of viruses from vaccinated with some but not all measles symptoms , one should attempt isolation of the virus from these patients.\n\u201d Plotkin 's conclusion is also interesting : `` The measles epidemics occurring in Europe and the United States could serve a useful purpose if specimens were obtained from exposed contacts before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scientific community should take advantage of the current situation brought on by vaccine resistance and vaccine ignorance to better define the correlates of measles immunity '' .\nI think it means more or less : we have no idea how the situation is changing , not we have no idea if vaccinations are effective , we have no idea how a vaccinated 's immune system reacts compared to that of a non-vaccinated , so we should take advantage of unvaccinated individuals and current epidemics to find out .\nThe real news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world population to mass experimentation , including by means of compulsory vaccination laws , without having the slightest idea of \u200b\u200bthe consequences that this will bring and will bring on public health .\nAnd now perhaps the most important question : how will the `` scientific community '' react to these considerations ?\nWill they remain silent ?\nWill they pretend that nothing has been said ?\nWill it invoke even more stringent and even more massive vaccination programs ?\nWhat will the WHO say about these admissions ?\nNote one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` new discoveries '' or a single newly published study ; simply , these data have been available to everyone for years , the pure evidence , only that now they have been put together and declared in writing by a personage that the `` scientific community '' can neither scoff at nor accuse of propagating `` fake news '' ; at best the great strategists will be able to decide to ignore everything , as is usually done with uncomfortable issues that are difficult to credibly deny ...\nThis article basically shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who work on scare-mongering , those who ignore scientific evidence are not the non-vaccinators , but those who pretend to have reliable data and certainties , those who play with people 's lives are not parents who are concerned about health of their children , but the authorities , the scientific community , the international bodies that pass off these vaccines as `` safe and effective '' without having the slightest scientific proof of what they say .\nSo pay

Petitioner alleges that Lauren \u2019 s vaccinations were a substantial factor in Lauren \u2019 s contraction of hemolytic anemia , causing her death .\nRespondent denies causation .\nThe court held a hearing in this case on May 10 , 2000 .\nTestifying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for respondent was Dr. Gregory H. Reaman .\nBoth are specialists in pediatrics , oncology , and hematology\u2026 .\nThat may have been considered a \u201c rare \u201d occurrence but researching Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia brought the following case studies up , also as a result of vaccination .\nIt \u2019 s important people are aware of this as it is a serious consequence , not always medically investigated , and can be fatal .\nAIHA can have an unknown origin or result from an underlying disease or medication .\nVaccines have been associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include weakness , fatigue , and jaundice .\nCold agglutinin disease ( CAD ) is one of the most common forms of AIHA , marked by the formation of autoantibodies against red blood cells formed upon exposure to cold temperatures .\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia , or AIHA , occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body \u2019 s own red blood cells , causing a reduction in the number of these cells and leading to hemolytic anemia .\n...\nThe court agrees with Dr. Shapiro that the significance of petitioner \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hemolytic process in vaccinees resulting in anemia .\nThe Federal Circuit in Knudsen states that requiring \u201c identification and proof of specific biological mechanisms would be inconsistent with the purpose and nature of the vaccine compensation program.\n\u201d 35 F.3d at 549 ( emphasis added ) .\nThe court does not find Dr. Reaman \u2019 s explanation of Lauren \u2019 s condition persuasive .\nFirst , Dr. Reaman admits that fever post-DPT is quite common .\nFor him to posit that Lauren \u2019 s 104-degree fever the evening of her five vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due to a viral illness , and not to the DPT , is not persuasive\u2026.The court is most impressed with the continuity of symptoms from the time of vaccinations until Lauren \u2019 s demise\u2026.There is also legal precedent to hold that vaccines cause hemolytic anemia\u2026 .\nShe has provided a prima facie case of causation in fact that any or all of the vaccinations Lauren received January 30 , 1997 caused in fact her acute hemolytic anemia and death .\nThe statute provides that she receive $ 250,000.00 in compensation Though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible for her AIHA and her death , how many other cases have lost ?\nHow many more vaccines are also now responsible as well ?\nHow heartbreaking .\nI dare bring this up for the possible horrible emails that I may get from those who deny vaccine injuries , but I don \u2019 t want any family to not know about this possibility .\nIt should not be happening and we need to make sure that our loved ones are safe .\nThe following are other case studies with a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks of hemolysis .\nThe first episode occurred 2 weeks after oral polio vaccination , and the second episode was observed 7 months later , when she received a simultaneous vaccination against mumps , rubella , and measles .\nThe DAT was strongly positive with anti-C3d .\nNo autoantibodies were detectable in either episode .\nThe boy experienced acute hemolysis a few days after a simultaneous revaccination against diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus , Haemophilus influenzae , hepatitis B , and polio .\nThe DAT using anti-IgG was strongly positive , and the DAT performed with anti-C3d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those forms of AIHA related to infectious diseases , and it may occur more frequently than has been reported .\nDiscussion : This case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) illustrates an extremely uncommon complication of routine vaccination in a healthy child .\nAlthough cases of AIHA have been reported after DTP , oral polio , hepatitis B , measles , H. influenza , smallpox , and other vaccines , no reports could be found implicating the varicella or pneumoccocal vaccines .\nThis child had the most common form of AIHA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually formed in response to infections , autoimmune disorders , immunodeficiency syndromes , malignancies , or medications .\nMortality from warm AIHA in the pediatric age group ranges from 9 to 29 % and is usually due to severe anemia or hemorrhage from associated thrombocytopenia .\nCorticosteroid therapy is first-line treatment followed by immunosuppressive drugs and splenectomy in refractory cases .\nOther treatment options include IVIG , plasmapheresis , and immunomodulary agents .\nAs the number of recommended childhood vaccines increase , pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of rare but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti\u2010Pr antibody induced cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia following pneumococcal vaccination : This is the first reported case of cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to anti\u2010Pr autoantibodies attributed to Pneumococcal vaccination in an adult patient .\nThe patient presented 1 week after receiving the vaccination with low hemoglobin , jaundice , and dyspnea with no prior history of anemia .\nExtensive workup including ruling out infectious and malignant causes was unremarkable , and his treatment consisted of transfusions and a course of steroids .\nAn autoantibody anti\u2010Pr was identified with persistence but decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial presentation .\nMost cases of this identified autoantibody are associated with infectious causes or vaccination associated in the pediatric population .\n\u2739 Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Following Influenza Virus Infection or Administration of Influenza Vaccine : AIHA associated with influenza infection or vaccination may be fatal in patients with primary illness who are in poor condition at the time of diagnosis \u2739 A Toddler With Rash , Encephalopathy , and Hemolytic Anemia : The VZV identified was confirmed to be Oka ( vaccine ) strain using 4 real-time Forster Resonance Energy Transfer PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA ) .\nIn addition , throat swabs obtained 2 months after vaccination were positive for vaccine-genotype mumps and rubella viruses by PCR .\n\u2739 Three Cases of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia following Primary Varicella Infection and Vaccination : Possible Pathogenesis in the Context of Current Information : A 14-month-old female patient was administered a measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccine at the age of one .\nShe suffered from a varicella infection one month after the vaccine was administered and recovered afterwards .\nShe presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her body a month after the varicella infection .\nThe IgA , IgM , IgG and IgE levels were normal but the CD3+ CD4+ lymphocyte value was low and CD3+ CD8+ lymphocyte value high in tests conducted with a suspicion of immunodeficiency when she was ten months old ( Table 1 ) .\nShe was referred to our hospital for the investigation of anemia and thrombocytopenia etiology .\nWe found out that her sister and brother had died with high fever when two months old .\nEvans ' syndrome is an uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously or sequentially ) of immune thrombocytopenia purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test in the absence of known underlying etiology .\nObjectives We present a case of Evans ' syndrome following influenza vaccination .\n\u2739 Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Following MF59-Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine Administration : A Report of Two Cases : Influenza vaccination may rarely trigger severe AIHA , shortly after vaccine administration .\nA mechanism of molecular mimicry is probably involved in the development of these reactions , although the possible role of adjuvants can not be excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and symptoms of autoimmune disorders occurring in the first weeks after administration of influenza vaccine \u2739 AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA-THREE CASES REPORT .\n: Case 3 .\n10-month old child manifested severe AIHA , 3 days after immunization ( diphtheria , poliomyelitis , pertussis and tetanus ) .\n, , , ,The result is intravascular destruction of the red cell .\nTwo clinical entities exist - one with cold reacting and the other one with warm reacting antibodies .\n\u2739 A Case Report of Coomb 's Positive Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia in pregnancy following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmune hemolytic anemia following DTP vaccination : report of a fatal case and review of the literature \u2026.Infection , disorders of autoantibody production , immunodeficiencies and malignancy may stimulate the production of autoantibodies that can result in AIHA 1 .\nWe report a fatal case of AIHA temporally related to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ( DTP ) vaccination It does not appear that \u201c rare \u201d gives an accurate portrayal of the number of vaccines that seem to cause Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia nor the devastating effects on a life .\nI am interested in autoimmmune diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe symptoms began after the MMR vaccine in 1994 , though other vaccines did cause more subtle reactions , often difficult to ascertain in an infant and toddler .\nMeg now also has a diagnosis of nonfamilial hypogammaglobulinemia , a condition in which her immune system is unable to mount a good fight against the bacterial , viral and parasitic bad guys in our world ( see the MMR insert below ) .\nThis cascade of events then unfortunately leads to another immune assault on her brain , called PANS .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSome questions to consider -- Why is it babies and children are not being tested for immune issues before vaccination ?\nCan certain vaccines trigger autoimmune diseases ?\nHow can this topic of conversation lead to helping children and adults rather than the whole \u201c anti-vaccination \u201d witch hunt ?\nOn the package insert for the MMR , you can read this as part of the That \u2019 s important to know but it is not mentioned by medical staff when getting the vaccine .\nI never was told as a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many children with autism , PANS/PANDAS or both , have immune issues .\nParents need to be vigilant and vocal to the increasing risks for safety .\nAs we watch states wanting to end religious/philosophical vaccine exemptions and make doctors intimidated to grant medical exemptions , these cases continue to grow .\nPoliticians need to be aware and alerted .\nBeing informed and wanting infants and children to be safe should not brand any doctor , parent , researcher or politician as \u201c anti-vaccine.\n\u201d God bless us , every one .\nTeresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

are Uniquely Vulnerable to Aluminium in Vaccines", "content": "Infants are Uniquely Vulnerable to Aluminium in Vaccines Professor Chris Exley | 9th January 2020 | Infection/Disease , Paediatrics , Pharmacy/Drugs The Hippocratic Post In 1984 , as an undergraduate at the University of Stirling , Scotland and while carrying out my first piece of independent research , I watched for the first time a fish , a salmon parr , die from acute aluminium toxicity .\nThe whole process took less than forty-eight hours .\nWithin six hours , the fish showed signs of distress and its behaviour changed markedly .\nIt proceeded to seek out the corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body against the side of the tank .\nAfter twenty-four hours , it began to move randomly and chaotically around the tank before losing its orientation , slipping onto its back , taking a last gasp , before dying .\nI was left in no doubt about the toxicity of aluminium .\nI am recalling this event herein because there does seem to be significant complacency concerning the toxicity of aluminium .\nAn Aluminium Adjuvant is Acutely Toxic Too In a recent post ( https : //www.hippocraticpost.com/pharmacy-drugs/the-toxicity-of-aluminium-adjuvants/ ) I explained why a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminium adjuvant is , akin to the salmon above , also an acute exposure to aluminium .\nIt is acute because the total concentration of aluminium in the immediate vicinity of the injection site is extremely high , in the case of a single dose of Infanrix Hexa vaccine , approximately 8000 times higher than is required to kill a salmon parr within forty-eight hours .\nEven allowing for some dilution of the injected aluminium adjuvant into body fluids bathing and innervating the tissues surrounding the injection site the total concentration of aluminium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell death within hours and perhaps minutes of receiving the injection .\nThis is the definition of an acute response , death ( cells or whole organism ) within a short period of exposure to a toxin .\nIt is a necrotic form of cell death .\nIt initiates an inflammatory response ( redness at the injection site ) .\nThis inflammation drives and perhaps accelerates the subsequent immune response ( https : //www.hippocraticpost.com/infection-disease/safety-concerns-aluminium-adjuvants/ ) .\nA number of mechanisms bring about remediation of acute aluminium toxicity at a vaccine injection site .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe toxic free metal ion , Al3+ , forms soluble and insoluble complexes with myriad biological molecules while particles of aluminium adjuvant and other insoluble aluminium compounds are taken up by cells infiltrating the vaccine injection site .\nAll of these processes act to reduce the acute toxicity of aluminium at the injection site by lowering the immediate concentration of toxic Al3+ .\nThese remedial processes act to secure aluminium in a number of different compartments .\nAll are systemic and all are potential sources of biologically reactive aluminium to the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where aluminium is bound in myriad different complexes including simple organic moieties like citrate or more complex proteins like the iron transport protein transferrin promote the transport of aluminium away from the injection site .\nThese processes can be envisaged as continuous passive diffusion of soluble aluminium away from the injection site .\nThe majority of injected aluminium adjuvant is particulate in the first instance and actively taken up , literally eaten , by a number of different cells infiltrating the injection site .\nSome particles of aluminium adjuvant are taken up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or close to the injection site as a granuloma .\nGenerally , these collections of macrophages are considered as benign \u2018 cancers \u2019 though such descriptions have been coined for situations where the cellular cargo is not aluminium .\nFor example , macrophagic myofasciitis or MMF is a disease , first described by Romain Gherardi in Paris , in which aluminium-rich granulomas at vaccine injection sites are implicated in disease aetiology .\nOther cells heavily laden with aluminium do not remain close to the injection site and carry their cargo well beyond where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting local lymph nodes as early stops on their travels .\nEvidence is mounting that these cells may transport aluminium into brain tissue using both lymph and blood as access routes .\nPerhaps most worrying , evidence of transport of aluminium into brain tissue across the blood-brain barrier and meninges has been shown in autism ( https :

on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I took Ronan in for his next appointment .\nThey said that I may change my mind if I do .\nThey said that \u2019 s because there were some questionable ingredients in some vaccines , like aborted fetal cells .\nThey said , as a Catholic , I might find use of these ingredients somewhat troubling\u2026or unethical\u2026or immoral .\nI looked at them like they were nuts and thought , Cancel the next appointment ?\nNot likely .\nAnd gee , thanks for butting in a private matter , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines ?\nAnd who were they to question me !\nThey were just another parent .\nThey had no background in the medical field .\nNo research articles written .\nNo degree in biology .\nNo history of formal studying of immunology or anything else related to the

smiled , nodded politely and walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one thought \u2013 who in their right mind believes that the pharmaceutical industry uses aborted fetal cells in their product ?\nThat \u2019 s just gross .\nHuman cells from an aborted baby ?\nYeah , right .\nSince I was still a firm believer in vaccines for my children , I shrugged off the person and their gentle suggestion to \u2018 read up on those vaccines \u2019 .\nRonan \u2019 s development hadn \u2019 t taken a major nosedive yet , so I carried on with what I knew \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment .\nBut before that

I searched , though \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became .\nAborted fetal cell lines were indeed part of the process !\nWhile this is a current screenshot , the practice dates back long before I spent time to look it up .\nThe initial Internet searches I did were time well spent .\nAs disheartened as I was , each time I went back to read more , I learned how much I didn \u2019 t know about vaccines .\nI also learned that should I continue to agree to them , I faced a dilemma \u2013 a moral dilemma .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t continue to accept the medical products my doctor and society insisted that my

learned that I had some options .\nThose were to get the shots ( despite my religious convictions ) , to find an alternative ( if one existed ) , or to skip them completely ( and pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay without them ) .\nOptions were good to have , but I had no idea which one to pick .\nI did know that I couldn \u2019 t continue to allow my children to be injected with the vaccines that had anything to do with aborted fetal cells , so I asked around to see if an alternative vaccine existed .\nTurns out , alternatives did exist !\nBut , how on earth would I obtain them ?\nI wasn \u2019 t a doctor .\nI didn \u2019 t run a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an \u201c in \u201d with a pharmaceutical company .\nI \u2019 d have to find a doctor who would order the other those lots , who would agree to take my children on as new patients and who would administer the vaccines I wanted him or her to special order .\nThat sounded impossible .\nThat \u2019 s why , as hard as it was to consider , I kept the last option in mind which was to skip the shots that I know knew were questionable to my faith .\nThat last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came with more risks than I wanted to consider .\nRemember as of yet , I was still a firm believer in all things vaccines .\nEven with what I was starting to read , which included learning about side effects and adverse events , I couldn \u2019 t wrap my head around how I was going to protect my children from what I thought were vaccine-preventable diseases .\nI honestly had no idea .\nI was just a Mom trying to do the right thing for her kids .\nThat meant @ @ @ @ @

through , I delayed Ronan \u2019 s next well-baby exam .\nI also inquired about getting vaccines that were not made with aborted fetal tissue .\nThose were available and recommended for those parents who found themselves face-to-face with the same decision like I myself was .\nComing < this > close to securing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were about to be made available to us , we were unable to get them .\nWhat ended up happening ?\nI opted for the vaccines that I could that were free of the ingredients I did not want to support .\nI also skipped the few others we were not able to obtain that Ronan was also \u201c due \u201d to receive .\nWas that the right choice ?\nAt the time , I thought yes .\nWould I make a different choice today like skip all the shots completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son \u2019 s story for any length of time , you know that the answer is yes .\nI would .\nAnd in a heartbeat .\nI would because as I look at that screenshot of the vaccine ingredients I posted above , I have issues with some of the other ingredients , too .\nI may not have had issues with them way back when , but I sure do now .\nBut I \u2019 ll save those thoughts for another post .\nToday \u2019 s post was to simply shed light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines found in vaccines .\nIt was also ask pro-lifers an important question : Where is the outrage ?\nWhere , I ask you ?\nBecause I don \u2019 t see any outrage like I think there would be and should be .\nAs I know it , to be pro-life means that one takes a stand to value and defend all life from natural conception to natural death in all circumstances .\nPeriod .\nIf there was outrage , that defending of all life in all circumstances would be happening .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to be true because those who state that they are pro-life would then not knowingly support the science or justify the use of aborted fetal cells lines in vaccines .\nAnd yet they do .\nMaybe it \u2019 s because they just don \u2019 t know .\nHeck , for as Catholic as I thought I was , I didn \u2019 t know either .\nBut I do now .\nNo matter how uncomfortable or sensitive the information may be , when the topic of vaccines comes up , the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient will also be included in my conversations .\nChurches and other pro-lifers may remain silent on the issue , but you have my word that the next time a young mom or dad asks for my

in prestige led to a step up in freedom and investigative autonomy .\nDan teamed up there with a young reporter named Mark Benjamin and together they embarked on a project that hit the big time : an investigation of the negative side effects of an anti-malaria drug called mefloquine .\nOr , as it was marketed by Roche Pharmaceuticals , Lariam .\n\u201c The Lariam project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Mark told me .\n\u201c It was a case of Dan deciding that we were going to take really damaging , but solid information on a bad drug and go up against one of the most powerful and deep-pocketed companies in the world , Roche .\nAnd it was one that had the Army and the CDC , quite literally , in its pocket.\n\u201d Lariam was widely used at the time in the Army and the Peace Corp and although

Dan , argued that any distribution of Lariam is too much .\n\u201c This new finding should motivate the U.S. military to consider further revising its mefloquine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether.\n\u201d Their work had many positive and unexpected ripple effects .\nMark and Dan were turned into a composite character , Sherm Hempell , on a Law and Order : SVU episode , which told a story of violence and murder in two Afghanistan war veterans that had taken an anti-malarial drug , Quinium .\nHappily , the good guys won and the Army cover-up was exposed .\nMore notably , in a real life case that

the CDC and its preferred programs that brought the UPI investigative pair to the vaccine issue , and in Dan \u2019 s case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the summer of 2003 , Mark pursued ( and Dan edited ) a story about conflicts of interest in the CDC \u2019 s recommended vaccine program , with a special focus on a little known vaccine inventor , Dr. Paul Offit , and the conflict between his role on the CDC

autistic children there and all of these were in the relatively small subset of vaccinated Amish .\nStarting with the Amish Anomaly , on April 19 , 2005 , Dan added dozens of articles to the series .\nHe stopped writing only when he was laid off at UPI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Last Word.\n\u201d Along the way , he found the first of Leo Kanner \u2019 s case series , Donald T. , the first of eight eventual discoveries and the heart of our book , The Age of Autism .\nFollowing his departure from UPI , Dan and I reached out to JB Handley and Kim Stagliano who had started their own blog , Rescue Post .\nOur joint venture went on line just a few months later .\nFrom the very beginning , Dan stayed close to the families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out talking to doctors on the front line of the epidemic , free thinkers like the late Meyer Eisenstein and Elizabeth Mumper .\nIn fact , the third column in the UPI series \u201c Sick Children \u201d took Dan \u2019 s readers to Liz Mumper \u2019 s pediatric practice in nearby Lynchburg Virginia .\nDan wrote \u201c Dr .\nElizabeth Mumper is an unlikely contrarian .\nMumper is a pediatrician in the southern Virginia city of Lynchburg .\nAbout a decade ago , Mumper said , she began noticing a change for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children she was seeing , including a startling rise in cases of autism .\nUltimately , Mumper came to suspect the increasing number of childhood vaccinations in the 1990s -- and particularly the mercury-based preservative called thimerosal in many of those vaccines -- was a big reason.\n\u201d Liz was a great source for Dan and me in our second book , Vaccines 2.0 .\nWhen I reached out to her yesterday to get her reflections on Dan , she described those initial meetings .\n\u201c Dan came to my office in 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a practice in which many of the children had chronic illness and neurodevelopmental disorders .\n.Dan had such an inquisitive mind and asked such great questions .\nI was surprised that a reporter who had not gone to medical school would understand and be able to synthesize complex medical information the way he could.\n\u201d Like many of us , Liz remarked on Dan \u2019 s tenacity and gift for words .\n\u201c What a gift to passionately seek answers to the unprecedented tsunami of childhood chronic illness !\nHe wove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , government organizations and pharmaceutical industries into compelling prose.\n\u201d Dan \u2019 s subsequent career -- 10 years here at the \u201c daily web newspaper of the autism epidemic \u201d ( he truly loved real printed newspapers ! )\n, two published books and a third on the way\u2014is all available here at Age of Autism .\nUnder Kim Stagliano \u2019 s leadership and with the help of our amazing group of contributing editors we are continuing the noble project Dan started .\nBut we do so with a heavy heart .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister Rosie , driving from Boston to Manhattan this Monday afternoon .\nWhen I got to the city I sat down for dinner and wept .\nI didn \u2019 t know quite what to do , so I typed out this FaceBook post , as tears smudged my iPhone .\nTo everyone who is sharing love for my great friend Dan Olmsted , please keep it up .\nDan deserved so much and I hope will ultimately get the recognition he deserves .\nDan was the consummate journalist .\nHe had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics and discipline of how good reporters should respond to and treat evidence .\nBut he was more than that .\nHe was a deeply original and creative investigator .\nThat combination was unique and compelling .\nDan was brilliant and compassionate and persistent and uncompromising and balanced and impatient .\nAll at once .\nAnd man !\ncould he put words together in such a graceful and powerful way .\nI was so fortunate to be his fellow traveler on the Age of Autism ( his phrase and it was so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\nI wish I had the words to say it as artfully as he could .\nI love you man .\nWe 'll all miss you .\nBut you kicked some ass .\nLater this week , I took my two daughters to dinner in Cambridge .\nDan got to know both of them quite well in our years working together .\nMy oldest , Sydney , traveled to Vienna with us as we researched the medical history of mercuric chloride treatments for syphilis and hysteria .\nMy youngest , Michaela ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autistic disorder ) , spent a lot of time with Dan in recent months ; he came to Cambridge a lot as we wrote our third book , Denial .\nSydney knew the news already , but when I picked them up we told Michaela about Dan \u2019 s death .\nShe often has difficulty processing emotions , especially sadness , in an appropriate way .\nBut when I told her , \u201c I have sad news , honey .\nDan is dead , \u201d I was pleased to see she was genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were feeling .\n\u201c Dan is dead , \u201d she repeated to herself in a subdued tone .\nTrying , in her way , to process the news .\nShe had grown up with Dan and knew how close our friendship was .\nLater in the evening , as we were walking into dinner at Legal Seafoods , she asked me an amusingly autistic but poignant question .\n\u201c Dad , \u201d she asked , \u201c are you going to get a replacement for Dan ?\n\u201d \u201c No , honey .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Mark Blaxill is Editor at Large for Age of Autism .",

backdrop of a far-away disease outbreak \u2013 which , as the CDC frequently states , is just a plane ride away .\n\u201c [ W ] e really don \u2019 t have very good safety monitoring communication in many countries ... we \u2019 re not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to a particular vaccine ... in most cases there is some obfuscation ... and therefore less and less trust in the system.\n\u201d Yet just five days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Swaminathan said the opposite : \u201c Vaccines are very safe .\nIf someone gets sick after vaccine , it is usually either a coincidence , an error in administering the vaccine administration , or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself .\nThat \u2019 s why we have vaccine safety systems \u2013 robust safety systems ... thoroughly monitored with support from the W.H.O.\n\u201d The factual disparity between WHO \u2019 s public relations content versus their members \u2019 empirical observations is shockingly clear in a video posted by The HighWire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2019 promo video , WHO \u2019 s Dr. Soumya Swaminathan , M.D .\nconfidently announced to the camera : At a Dec. 2 , 2019 closed-door meeting , WHO officials admitted alarming limitations in their knowledge of vaccines \u2019 effects .\nSaid Prof. Heidi Larson , Ph.D. : \u201c We need much more investment in safety science , \u201d adding that most doctors receiveonly a half-day of college vaccine education .\nA number of WHO officials voiced concerns about : The widespread rot of vaccine misinformation is rooted in the U.S. Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control , and the World Health Organization .\n\u201c [ U.S. Centers for Disease Control ] officials were so panicked by AHRC \u2019 s revelations that they killed the AI system-wide roll-out.\n\u201d \u201c Those government researchers found that 2.6 % of vaccination resulted in injuries \u2013 a ratio of one for every 39 vaccines administered .\nIn 2010 , the Federal Agency for Health Care Research ( AHCR ) ran a pilot study \u201c to test the efficiency of a state-of-the-art machine counting ( AI ) system on data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d reported the advocacy group Children \u2019 s Health Defense : How many lawmakers would pass oppressive vaccine mandates if they knew that government evidence showed 1 in 39 people suffer health damage from vaccines ?\nPharma-funded vaccine bills have become a litmus test of legislators \u2019 knowledge , priorities and ethics \u2013 and a chilling testament to corporations \u2019 metastasizing abuse of civil rights and democratic processes .\nBy Nancy Hokkanen As legislatures across America debate coercive vaccine mandate bills , pharmaceutical lobbyists and their paid proxies are barraging lawmakers with questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and federal lawmakers will be manipulated into letting profit-focused corporations set vaccine policy for all citizens , regardless of inability to tolerateinjections with potentially hazardous ingredients ?\nGlobal pharmaceutical companies profit immensely from citizens \u2019 chronic illnesses ( many linked to vaccine adverse reactions ) while also getting away with : \u2022 false claims they have removed mercury from shots , while increasing aluminum \u2022 bearing no financial liability for vaccine-induced injuries or deaths .\nWhy the dissonance between public health stakeholders \u2019 PR and the actual health outcomes of the citizens they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts that the declining Western society \u201c toils unconsciously in the grip of a stifling \u2018 corporatist \u2019 structure that serves the needs of business managers and technocrats as it promotes the segmentation of society into competing interest groups and ethnic blocks.\n\u201d That ethos is made manifest in pharma front groups , whose employeessupply human faces to mask corporate avarice .\nIn 2019 , corporations spent $ 295,165,093 on pharmaceuticals/health products lobbying .\nThe global value of high-stakes biopharmaceutical goods and services is $ 1.1 trillion total , according to the Pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nHealth companies spend $ 30 billion on medical marketing \u2013 yet \u201c regulatory oversight remains limited.\n\u201d Pharmaceutical companies fund front groups ( e.g .\nVoices for Vaccines , and PhRMA \u2019 s Voters For Cures ) that meet with state and federal lawmakers .\nThese nonprofits-for-hire skirt lobbying laws while promoting bills to secure long-term , high-volume vaccine contracts for manufacturers .\nFront groups push intrusive legislation to remove consumers \u2019 exemptions from vaccines \u2013which increases corporations \u2019 customer base , at the expense of individuals \u2019 health .\nPharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by redirecting attention from evidence of vaccine failures , and stoking unreasonable fear of treatable diseases .\nGroup members publicly intimidate vaccine injury victims and \u201c refusers , \u201d encouraging their oppression by portraying them as conspiracy theorists or a threat to public health .\n( Or both . )\nMany front groups are astroturf groups : \u201c fake grassroots , \u201d according to investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson : \u201c Entities deploy surreptitious methods to make us believe ordinary people in grassroots efforts are speaking to an issue when , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pulling the strings .\nIt \u2019 s cloaked propaganda.\n\u201d Adding insult to vaccine injury are front group mouthpieces who sing the praises of regulatory agency capture , increasing the spread of opportunistic medical misinformation from the top down , with a viral global reach .\nPhRMA helps fund the American Medical Association ( AMA ) and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) , and their trade publications , the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) and Pediatrics .\nAMA and AAP \u2019 s dues-paying members buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lobby state legislatures .\nMedical trade unions whose members showcasetheir Hippocratic oath conversely promote liability-free vaccines \u2013 like pharmaceutical companies , they bear no financial responsibility if their patients \u2019 health is harmed by that product .\nA 2016 JAMA study of pediatric adverse drug reactions revealed that in children under five years old who required emergency room admissions , 19.5 % had suffered vaccine injuries ( Shehab et al.\n, \u201c US Emergency Department Visits for Outpatient Adverse Drug Events.\n\u201d ) Yet AMA and AAP play little proactive role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vaccine adverse reactions .\nIf you are injured by a vaccine , you \u2019 re on your own \u2013 unless you connect with any of many endlessly growing networks of vaccine injury victims .\nInstead of recognizing patients \u2019 medical susceptibility to vaccine adverse reactions , Minnesota \u2019 s AAP branch essentially promotes vaccine mandates \u2019 one-size-fits-all medical treatment : \u201c Public health comes first and foremost .\nWhen anti-vaxxers start to talk about personal freedom , remember that state and federal law rightly allows the government to protect the health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not be injured by a medical intervention \u2013 especially one forced upon them by government .\nPublic health policymakers \u2019 \u201c greater good \u201d excuse is chilling in its selective regard for human life , and willingness to coerce fellow humans into health-altering medical interventions by using punitive legal oppressions .\nMoral philosopher John Bordley Rawls states in A Theory of Justice : \u201c Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole can not override ...\nIt does not allow that the sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many\u2026 the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests.\n\u201d The Atlanta-based Task Force for Global Health was founded in 1984 by a former director of the CDC , with the goal of raising childhood vaccination rates globally .\nThis \u201c non-State actor \u201d boasts \u201c powerful partnerships \u201d that include funders such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , Merck , Novartis , Pfizer , CDC and WHO .\nIn 2019 TFGH absorbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 to \u201c build trust in the safety of vaccines \u201d \u2013 but actually generated fraudulent research intended to erase evidence of vaccine adverse reactions .\nVaccinate Your Family ( formerly Every Child By Two ) exemplifies profit-first mission creep in its very name change.The group lobbies state legislatures and Congress to create mandates and eliminate exemptions .\nVYF is funded by vaccine manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline , Merck , Pfizer and Sanofi Pasteur .\nThe Immunization Action Coalition , based in Minnesota , receives funding via a CDC grant and from pharmaceutical companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be vaccinated , even tying it to driver \u2019 s license eligibility .\nIAC encouragesmedical clinics to insert standing orders for vaccinations into patient records , through deceptive communications instead of informed consent .\nIAC executive director Deborah Wexler also serves on other vaccine group boards .\nVoices For Vaccines , which lobbies legislatures to eliminate vaccine exemptions , is a funded program of the Task Force for Global Health , which owns the V4V website .\nA detailed 2014 investigative article features charts detailing ethically conflicted financial relationships amongst the Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emory University and vaccine manufacturers .\nVoices for Vaccines , co-founded by Minnesota mom Karen Ernst , issues inane pronouncements devoid of factual reference , such as these hostile 2014 Tweets : \u201c Stop using # autism as a reason not to vaccinate.\n\u201d \u201c The privilege of living among so many others who vaccinate makes anti-vaxxers feel complacent.\n\u201d Ernst is paid to fly across the country attending other states \u2019 legislative hearings , and recording videos of people who oppose forced vaccination .\nWhen she herself was asked by Washington State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum toxicity , Ernst \u2019 s evasive stumbling and hasty retreat showed that intellectually she is way out of her depth .\nAround the world , countries are banning Monsanto \u2019 s herbicide glyphosate due to its scientifically proven carcinogenicity \u2013 yetin 2019 Ernst posted on Facebook : \u201c Roundup does not cause cancer .\nThe lawyer in that Roundup lawsuit was RFK Jr , who is a kook .\nThe one study that suggested cancer was retracted .\nRoundup is one of the least toxic herbicides we have.\n\u201d Really , Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent glyphosate researchers beg to differ \u2013 not to mention that \u201c least toxic \u201d still means \u201c toxic.\n\u201d Also Ernst fails to consider cumulative body burden over months and years of contaminant consumption , especially in small children .\nErnst is a fan of pioneering vaccine developer Dr. Stanley Plotkin \u2013 a man revered or reviled , depending on whether you profited from his experiments , or were victimized by them .\nOrphans , lacking a caring parent to deny consent , were used byPlotkin for his unethical medical experiments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a V4V advisor ; Ernst \u2019 s request that he testify in a court case ended up backfiring .\nDuring a January 11 , 2018 deposition of Dr. Plotkin , conducted by New York attorney Aaron Siri , the vaccine researcher was ( as reported by columnist Levi Quackenboss ) : \u201c forced to admit that over his career he \u2019 d tested his vaccines on mentally retarded children , orphans , and babies born to female inmates\u2026 Needless to say , the very next morning Dr. Stanley Plotkin withdrew from testifying as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer felt confident to speak about the safety and necessity of the products that made him a millionaire.\n\u201d Ernst shows similar callous disregard for other humans \u2019 vaccine-induced suffering \u2013 recklessly indulging her overt schadenfreude with heartless grave-dancing when crashing events to honor vaccine injury victims , living and dead .\nOver the past 10 years , mainstream media has usually failed to report factually or fully on vaccine safety issues , or blacks it out entirely .\nConspicuous by their absence are consumer-focused investigations into problems with vaccine efficacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens \u2019 civil rights abuses .\nThe problem is journalists \u2019 recent willingness to accept CDC \u2019 s PR statements as fact , rather than doing a deep dive , following the money and finding the frauds .\nFacebook billionaire and community journalism funder Mark Zuckerberg made observations about journalism that extend to legislative discussions of bills : \u201c You \u2019 re not going to be able to bridge common ground , unless you have a \u201c common set of facts so that you can at least have a coherent debate.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence \u201d on vaccine safety is based on fraudulent research , then it \u2019 s a mountain of garbage .\nVaccine safety advocates defendeveryone \u2019 s freedom of speech and right to publish well-referenced information about all medical products \u2013 an absolute necessity when honest information is not forthcoming from industry or government .\nPharmaceutical companies spend $ 6 billion on drug advertising declaring vaccines as safe and necessary \u2013 backed up by front groups demanding that anyone refusing the product should face loss of privileges and punitive penalties .\nThese tactics influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op-eds strategically planted in advance of legislation and afterward .\nAnd with large influential publications bought by billionaires who own vaccine-related businesses , money wins again .\nA peculiar media hybrid is emerging : A national network of reporters focusing on state capitol coverage , writing articles for new and traditional forums .\nOne such organization \u201c backed by non-disclosed donors \u201d is States Newsroom , whose \u201c non-profit \u201d Minnesota Reformer hires former writers from the less-than-objective Minneapolis Star Tribune .\nThe noble-sounding but disingenuous mission of the presumptuously named Reformer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government tracking what elected officials are up to \u2013 and monitoring the powerful forces trying to influence them.\n\u201d But the MN Reformer turns misinformer with its biased February 9 article : \u2022 pejoratively uses \u201c anti-vaccine \u201d instead of \u201c vaccine safety advocate \u201d ; \u2022 leverages measles fear , but neglects to mention the cases in vaccinated people ; \u2022 fails to address biological studies on vaccine adverse reactions , substituting polls and opinions from financial stakeholders ; \u2022 omits interviews with victims or parents of vaccine-injured children , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With mainstream media \u2019 s ad revenues dependent on medical companies , these public-private collaborations can devolve into \u201c news for hire \u201d services that churn copy customized for any agenda\u2026 which amounts to public relations .\nThe sad state of the Fourth Estate as described by the Columbia Journalism Review : \u201c Journalism likes long reads , but right now it needs the money more.\n\u201d Back in 1950 , pharmaceutical pioneer George Merck remarked on financial conflicts of interest : \u201c We try never to forget that medicine is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits.\n\u201d In April 2016 , Mayo Clinic \u2019 s Dr. Gregory Poland , a Merck vaccine developer , gave a PowerPoint presentation to the national lobbying group Women In Government on how to incentivize state legislatures to promote vaccines for adults : \u201c If a private donor could be identifies who would provide each of you a $ 1,000,000 \u2018 grant \u2019 IF you developed legislation and policies that materially improved the health of your states and communities \u2013 could/would you do it ?\n\u201d In 2018 Dr. Alix Casler , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HPV symposium put on by Maryland Department of Health staff .\nDr. Casler encouraged attendees to offer free dinners , wine and sales bonuses to encourage physicians to promote HPV vaccines , such as Merck \u2019 s Gardasil .\nIn November 2019 , U.S .\nRight To Know reported that the CDC \u2019 s National Foundation took \u201c nearly $ 80 million from drug companies and other commercial manufacturers during fiscal years 2014-2018.\n\u201d By 2023 , global pharmaceutical spending is estimated to reach $ 1.5 trillion .\nGreed has corrupted many vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even institutions of higher learning into enabling research fraud or facilitating corporation-driven government policies .\nWorse , that greed has blocked access to truthful information about vaccines \u2019 risks and limitations \u2013 but by motivating ethical citizens , that is a solvable problem .\nOrganized , informed citizens are using their constitutional rights to speak out against corrupt government and industry practices that harm health .\nAd hoc watchdog groups alert legislators to corrupt practices by federal agencies , which can infect state policies .\nThe National Vaccine Information Centerand Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine billsthat hold powers that be accountable : \u2022 HAWAII introduced a bill to allow conscientious exemptions for children \u2019 s vaccines .\n\u2022 SOUTH DAKOTAintroduced House Bill 1235 that would prohibit schools from requiring immunizations .\nHB 1235 states : \u201c No public or nonpublic post secondary educational institutions may mandate any immunizations for school entry .\nA public or private post secondary educational institution may request any student to submit medical records .\nNo educational institution may use coercive means to require immunization.\n\u201d \u2022 MINNESOTAintroduced SF 3110 ( known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states ) : \u201c Vaccine minimum safety standards requirement for any vaccine required to enroll or remain enrolled in an elementary or secondary school.\n\u201d \u2022 IDAHOfiled a bill that would prohibit discrimination based on vaccination status .\nPublic health policies propelled by the \u201c good intentions \u201d of legislators , state immunization departments , and medical professionals are perversely damaging countless people \u2019 s health \u2013 and forcing citizens from schools , jobs , homes and communities .\nAmerican taxpayers can not allow their legislatures to

announcement : in that state one in every 34 children has autism .\nNew Jersey is credited with having a statewide registry of children with autism so their identification of the disorder is considered very accurate .\nBack in 2006 when I first wrote about The Really Big Lie the official autism rate was one in every 166 children in the U.S .\nThings continued to get worse as the years

greater awareness , \u201d and \u201c an expanded definition \u201d of the disorder .\nThis article referred to the universally promoted idea that all the kids with autism everywhere were really nothing new .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were called something else or their condition went unrecognized by doctors and teachers .\nBy Anne Dachel Fourteen years ago , when I was in the early stages of my coverage of autism in the news , I wrote a piece that was published on Scoop.co.nz entitled , The Really Big Lie About Autism .\nOn Feb 13 a news report from Brainerd , Minnesota announced that 22 % of the students there were getting special education services there .\n( Minnesota \u2019 s state average is 16 % . )\nStatistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last couple of years reveal some other higher than average numbers in that state : Duluth 17 % SPED , Austin 17.3 % SPED , Red Wing 18 % SPED , Minneapolis 18 % SPED , Bemidji 20 % SPED And remember the official U.S. percent for students receiving SPED services is 14 \u201c Brainerd stayed consistent with 22 % of students reported to receive special education services in 2018 as well .\nThe district percentage has increased over the last five years , though , from 18.6 % in 2015 .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015.\n\u201d A big part if this is autism \u201c In Brainerd , students primarily fall into one of the following disability categories : speech/language , learning disability , emotional/behavioral , other health disabled , autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay .\nThe highest number of students \u2014 360 \u2014 are considered to have learning disabilities , with the next highest category being developmental delay at 318 , followed by autism spectrum disorder at 237 .\nThe developmental delay category had the highest increase from 2015 at 43 % .\n\u201d And developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted to continue in Brainerd .\n\u201c Superintendent Laine Larson said she expects to see more increases in that category in the coming years as well , so the district will keep that in mind moving forward.\n\u201d As implausible as it may sound , the special education assistant director attributed the stunning numbers to \u201c earlier detections of the disability and more referrals from doctors.\n\u201d This absurd explanation makes doctors and educators look completely incompetent .\nHow did they miss these kids in the past ?\nWhy were their needs ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolds On Feb 3 an eye-opening piece was published on the California education site Ed100 called , Special Education Costs Flood School Budgets .\nIt focused on state statistics .\n\u201c The rising costs of special education services are overwhelming your school district budget .\nAnd we are talking big bucks .\nNearly 800,000 students in California receive special education services \u2014 about one in every eight students.\n\u201d \u201c The cost of providing special education services in California has grown significantly over time .\nIn 2017-18 the total cost was about $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislative Analyst Office this represented an increase of about 28 percent over a decade earlier , adjusted for inflation .\nThe percentage of students receiving special education services jumped from 11 percent to 13 percent.\n\u201d A major reason costs are increasing is because there are more kids with autism .\n\u201c About two-thirds of the cost increases reflect the growing number of students with severe disabilities , especially autism .\nAccording to the Legislative Analyst Report , \u2018 The share of students identified with autism has increased from 1 in 600 students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in 2018-19.\n\u2019 \u201d We \u2019 re not told why there are more kids with autism in California schools , but their cost is undeniable .\nWhile the writer , Carol Kocivar , former President of the California State PTA , was mostly concerned with the failure of the federal government to cover their share of the cost of educating special needs students , her statistics don \u2019 t lie : there are more disabled students in California schools especially ones with AUTISM .\nThen on Feb 16 , the piece California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing was published by CalMatters really got to the point .\nIt was written by Jill Escher , a mother with two severely affected children with autism .\nShe

5 in the case of mumps , the figure is typically 95-100 % .\n6 So even if everyone was vaccinated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new laws require , similar outbreaks are virtually certain to continue .\n\u200b2 ) that vaccines are so effective that only the unvaccinated are still susceptible and thus capable of transmitting the disease to others .\n\u200bIn any case , the hysteria behind the present campaign to eliminate all religious and philosophical exemptions is utterly disproportionate to the facts on the ground .\nMy own state of Massachusetts has seen 0-3 measles cases per year for the last 5 years , and only44 cases in the past decade , 3 with 97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our seventh-graders already vaccinated with the MMR , 4 well above the official target of 95 % for the stricter new mandate that it has in mind .\n\u200bI 'll take the easy one first .\nThe public hysteria that has led a number of states to declare an emergency arose largely in response to measles outbreaks in 2016 and 2019 .\nWhile a little larger than in the recent past , these were still quite small , localized , and in most respects similar to those recorded in every year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 1000 cases in 2019 , compared to a few hundred in the years since 2000 , when the CDC prematurely declared the disease eliminated from the United States , 1 and anywhere from 400,000-800,000 cases annually in the pre-vaccine era .\n2 If the CDC would just admit that they were a little hasty , and that such outbreaks are bound to occur , they could still claim a historic victory over this formerly ubiquitous disease .\nIt 's also worth remembering that virtually everyone of my generation came down with measles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nobody thought it an emergency back then , so there was no urgent need for a vaccine in the first place .\n\u200bAs a GP with more than 50 years ' experience in treating children and their families , I feel it my duty to speak out against the new vaccine mandates , for three main reasons .\nThe first is that there is no emergency to justify vaccinating children against their parents ' wishes , let alone keeping them out of school if they refuse .\nThe second is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and effective falls far short of the rigorous standards that valid medical science must follow .\nThe third is that the Nuremberg Code and the Helsinki Declaration , both of which we helped write and still profess to abide by , explicitly forbid any medical procedure , treatment , or experiment undertaken without the fully-informed consent of the recipient .\nNote : I have had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Moskowitz .\nHe personifies the dignified doctor of `` yore '' when patients came first .\nHe is the author of Vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I invite you to share this article he has written to address the current crushing slate of vaccine mandates .\nHere in my state of Connecticut , we are waiting for a vote on HB 5044 which will remove our religious vaccination exemption .\nKim # # # By Richard Moskowitz , M. D. \u200bMy second reason for writing is to show that vaccines are much less safe and effective than we 've been led to believe .\nKeep in mind that they 're given purely on the basis of long-term health policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine public-health emergency .\nMost of them are directed against \u200ba ) diseases that were once life-threatening , but already declining in incidence and mortality before the vaccines were introduced , thanks to improvements in sanitation , water quality , and other public-health measures ( diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus ) ; 11 \u200bb ) ordinary diseases of childhood that most people contracted and recovered from without complications or sequelae ( measles , mumps , rubella , flu , rotavirus , chickenpox ) ; 12 or \u200bc ) sporadic illnesses linked to mutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our normal flora and relatively seldom cause invasive disease ( pneumococcus , HiB ) .13 \u200bTo be pronounced effective , vaccines need satisfy just two narrow criteria : a significant reduction in the incidence , morbidity , and mortality of the corresponding illnesses following their use ; and significant , prolonged increases in the level of serum antibodies against the micro-organisms targeted by them .\n\u200b Vaccines achieving these objectives often prove to have been much less successful when investigated more systematically .\nFor two reasons , the flu vaccine , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when it succeeds in preventing many cases of the strain it is directed against : first , because the extreme mutability of the influenza viruses virtually guarantees that a different vaccine will be needed every year , and sometimes even within the same season , with different specifications that can not be known in advance ; and second , because the generic illness we know as `` the flu '' is linked to many different viruses , by no means restricted to the influenza group for which it is named .\n\u200bSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other vaccines as well .\nEven when they satisfy both criteria , the viruses and bacteria they are directed against reliably mutate into different strains of the same or closely-related organisms , which are not counted in the statistics , a process which is greatly accelerated by these determined and systematic attempts to eliminate them .\n\u200bThe pneumococcus and HiB organisms , for example , are linked to sporadic cases of pneumonia , meningitis , endocarditis , and septicemia involving mutant strains of bacteria that normally reside in the nasopharynx of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting them have already elicited new , resistant , and even more pathogenic strains that are altering and will continue to alter that important ecosystem in ways that the CDC and the drug industry can not foresee and indeed seem myopically unconcerned about.14 \u200bA more imminent threat is whooping cough , which was rapidly declining in incidence and mortality before the pertussis vaccine was introduced the 1940 's , but has reappeared with a vengeance in the last 20 years , again mainly in vaccinated individuals , and involving , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant to the vaccine , and a wholly new species that strikes mainly the vaccinated.15 \u200bAnother is polio , against which both the oral and injectable vaccines have been somewhat effective in preventing large-scale outbreaks like those of the 1950 's .\nIn India , which uses the cheaper live , oral version , an even more virulent form of paralytic disease , clinically indistinguishable from the original , has become prevalent in recent years , and was conveniently named Non-Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis , or NPAFP , lest anyone suspect that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , which declared polio officially eliminated years ago , and has reverted to the original injectable or killed vaccine , another very similar disease has emerged , named Acute Flaccid Myelitis ( AFM ) for the same reason , with the related enterovirus D-68 widely suspected as the cause.17 \u200bLikewise , the level of specific antibodies in the blood has dismally failed to provide an accurate measure of immune status after vaccination .\nEven their advocates admit that vaccines are never completely effective , since most targeted diseases continue to break out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we saw.18 These alleged `` vaccine failures '' are then invoked to impose additional booster doses , based on the assumptions \u200b1 ) that they represent `` bad batches , '' and nothing more ; \u200b2 ) that low antibody levels in the vaccinated mean that the vaccines have simply `` worn off , '' leaving behind nothing but a `` blank slate ; '' \u200b3 ) that the titer can be ratcheted up to the desired level by simply adding more shots ; and \u200b4 ) that the antibody level is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the extent to which the vaccinated are resistant to infection with the natural disease .\n\u200bUnfortunately , none of these assumptions stands up to careful scrutiny .\nFirst , we already know but choose to forget that the titer ca n't be simply manipulated at will by adding more boosters .\nIn 1980 , Dr. James Cherry , a leading vaccine advocate , discovered that children receiving the MMR who later developed low titers responded to a booster dose only minimally and for an unacceptably short time.19 A few years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to do something drastic , Cherry 's research was quietly shelved , the booster was mandated , and it remains in force to this day .\n\u200bThen in 1986 , a clustering of several hundred measles cases were reported in the Midwest , of which 94 % were in vaccinated schoolchildren , and a sizable number were unusually mild , with a paler rash , no fever , and minimal discomfort , fatigue , or other systemic involvement.20 The scientists researching the outbreak were startled to learn that the milder version was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , while the typical acute illness affected mainly vaccinated kids with high titers in the supposedly `` immune '' range.21 \u200bIndicating viral activity in both subgroups that serological testing had failed to detect , these findings led me to wonder if vaccines with low levels of antibody were being misidentified as susceptible , inappropriately revaccinated , and thus subjected to further complications that were also overlooked .\nSoon after , I chanced to witness just such a misfortune when asked to review a damage compensation claim following the Hep B vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech who developed a nasty cough lasting for many months after a series of three Hep B shots as required for her training .\nWhen she applied for a job four years later , her serum showed zero antibodies to the virus , and her new employer , supposing her to be still susceptible , insisted on a second round .\nThis time she relapsed almost immediately , with an even more intense version of the same cough , followed by a sequence of new complaints , including nodular goiter , Hashimoto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxiety , requiring maintenance doses of several drugs and medical supervision all year round ; and her claim was denied without even a hearing , because none of her complaints were officially-approved complications of the vaccine.22 \u200bAs to safety , vaccine safety trials , virtually without exception , are funded , conducted , and micromanaged by the manufacturers themselves , and then rubber-stamped by the government agencies that are supposed to be regulating them , a more blatant style of corruption pithily summarized by a former Vice-President of Pfizer who had witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u200bEverybody is out there begging for money .\nThe big international corporations have lots of money .\nThey give grants for research , pay doctors and researchers thousands to travel around , speak at conferences , and establish educational \u200bprograms , all to make profits for their products .\nThe safety trials are supposed to be third-party and independent , but the money wo n't keep coming unless \u200bthey say what you want them to say .\nEverybody knows this is how things \u200bwork .\nOnly the public does n't know it.23 \u200bThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse reactions include the following : \u200b1 ) instead of inert placebo , the so-called `` control '' groups are given the toxic chemical ingredients of the vaccines under study , or a different vaccine entirely ; 24 \u200b2 ) to qualify as vaccine-related , adverse reactions must occur within hours , or days , or at most a week or two after the shot , thus arbitrarily ruling out the entire chronic dimension , within which the majority of them occur.25 \u200b3 ) they must appear on the vanishingly small list already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of discovering new ones ; and \u200b4 ) adverse effects reported by the recipients but not specifically asked about by the research team are subject to numerous restrictions , with the lead investigator given complete authority to disqualify them , based on criteria that are never specified.26 Naturally , the upshot of these shenanigans has been massive underreporting of adverse reactions , estimated at somewhere between 1 % and 0.1 % of the true figure.27 \u200bThe manufacturers have been in command of the process ever since the 1980 's , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain damage following the DPT vaccine , whereupon they threatened to stop making vaccines entirely unless Congress excusedthem from all further liability.28 In 1986 , Congress acceded to their ultimatum by passing the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act , which created the taxpayer-funded VICP program for compensating claims , and deprived patients and experimental subjects of their right to sue the manufacturer for damages,29 a free ride granted to no other industry .\nIn 2011 , the Supreme Court actually signed off on this devil 's bargain , ruling that vaccines are `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry must indeed be excused for whatever deaths or injuries may result from them !\n30 \u200b \u200bAs a GP caring for families , I 've always felt uneasy about giving vaccines routinely , because the diseases they 're designed to prevent are acute illnesses , with high fever and a massive , concerted outpouring of immune mechanisms that succeed in expelling the invading organism from the body , whereas vaccination , by contrast , is by definition a chronic process , involving long-term antibody production as an isolated phenomenon that requires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the host for years , with no obvious path or mechanism for getting rid of it.31 \u200bIn light of the industry 's successful campaign for concealing the harm done by vaccines , the simplest way to approximate the extent of it is to look at it in reverse , at the major health benefits to be acquired by not vaccinating , and simply allowing our children to acquire the ordinary diseases that most of them would naturally be exposed to .\nMany studies have shown that children who come down with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like measles , mumps , rubella , chickenpox , and influenza , are significantly less likely to develop chronic autoimmune diseases and cancer later in life than those merely vaccinated against them.32 \u200bAnother important finding is that the risk of death , hospitalization , and major adverse reactions following vaccines depends much less on which one , than the total number of individual vaccines administered , both simultaneously at the same visit,33 and cumulatively over the patient 's lifetime.34 That purely quantitative threat makes it clear that these worst outcomes are not simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few hypersensitive individuals , but regular , predictable consequences of some fundamental property built into the vaccination process itself .\n\u200bAll by themselves , these studies provide ample justification for questioning and doubting the prevailing assumptions that vaccines are uniformly safe and effective , that they save vast sums of money from not having to care for patients suffering from the corresponding diseases , and that it is OK and even desirable to pile on as many different ones as the traffic will bear .\n\u200bAccording to the CDC 's current guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a total of 70 doses of individual vaccines by the age of 18,35 and 149 by age 65.36 That does n't even count the 200-plus vaccines still in the pipeline,37 and the others sure to follow , with no regulation or restraint , and often for no better reason than that we possess the technical capacity to make them .\nIncentivized with a blank check of that size , it becomes ever more unlikely that children who obey these guidelines will get to live out a full lifespan , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer and die before their time .\n\u200bAnother bottom line of the fake emergency , and the bad science cited to justify it , is the aggressive campaign by the drug industry , the CDC , and the doctors who follow their lead to dispense with fundamental human rights that have long been inseparable from our democratic way of life , upheld in our courts , and still loudly proclaimed even by those most determined to take them away .\n\u200bWithout a real emergency , forcing parents to vaccinate their children against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their deepest instincts : \u200ba ) denies them the right to choose the form of health care that they feel is best for their children ; \u200bb ) forces them to accept an unnecessary and unsafe medical procedure without their fully-informed consent ; and \u200bc ) forfeits their children 's right to an education if they persist in refusing the procedure .\n\u200bIn contemporary case law , the legal right of parents to decide which form of health care will be given to their children is not absolute , and has been suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted physicians and hospitals temporary custody to perform emergency surgery , for example , when their parents refused to allow it on religious grounds.38 But most vaccinations are given routinely , to prevent diseases that are not imminent , only rarely dangerous , and may never even be in the vicinity .\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \u200bIn any case , the right of medical patients and experimental subjects to refuse any medical intervention or procedure without their fully-informed consent was unequivocally affirmed in both the Nuremberg Code , which the United States helped write and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atrocious Nazi medical experiments in World War II , and the Helsinki Declaration , `` Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects , '' which elaborates on the same issues in a passage that could almost have been written with the vaccine mandates in mind : \u200bIn medical research involving competent human subjects , each potential \u200bsubject must be adequately informed of the aims , methods , sources of funding , \u200bany possible conflicts of interest , institutional affiliations of the researcher , \u200banticipated benefits and potential risks of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any other relevant aspects of the study .\n\u200bThe potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in \u200bthe study , or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal .\n\u200bAfter insuring that the potential subject has understood the information , the \u200bphysician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the \u200bpotential subject 's freely-given informed consent , preferably in writing.39 Regarding children 's right to an education , the ACLU sums it up perfectly : \u200bAll children living in the United States have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Constitution requires that all be given equal educational \u200bopportunity , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion , or sex , and whether rich or \u200bpoor , citizen or non-citizen .\nEven those in this country illegally have the right \u200bto go to public school.40 It is not difficult to imagine a genuine public health emergency , such as a deadly plague or imminent bioterrorist attack , in which it might be necessary to suspend all of these rights temporarily .\nBut small , localized outbreaks of ordinary childhood diseases most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less could they justify depriving children of their right to an education for the rest of their lives .\nThe upside-down politics behind the mandates .\n\u200bI have always felt that protecting the rights of parents and children by defeating the new mandates should logically be a popular , winning issue for liberal and progressive politicians , as well as organizations protecting civil liberties , public radio and TV stations , and a majority of the news media .\n\u200bAt the moment , however , the strictest of the new laws have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue states , while their main opponents seem more closely aligned with the GOP , claiming descent from Ronald Reagan and seeing government regulation itself as the problem .\nAs for the Democrats , even the fiercest critics of Big Pharma shy away from questioning their motives when it comes to vaccines , and even recycle their favorite talking points.41,42 Meanwhile , as if in lockstep , the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Boston Globe , and various NPR radio and TV stations have likewise maintained a united front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged emergency as settled fact , stigmatizing `` anti-vaxxers '' as deluded or ignorant crazies , and declining to publish or give credence to dissenting views.43,44 Some like Congressman Adam Schiff have gone even further , directing Facebook and Google to censor all content opposing vaccines or questioning the mandates , in overt defiance of the First Amendment.45 \u200bYet the politicians , the news media , and the general public deserve blame mainly for believing without questioning , for taking on faith what they 're being told by medical and and scientific `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that vaccines are safe and effective , that the science is settled , that the emergency is real , and that vaccinating everybody is the only solution .\nIn an ideal world , or even the well-functioning democracy that we habitually claim to be , we should be able to trust our doctors to know and speak the truth , and to be open to changing our minds when new facts are brought to light .\nThe fact that we are n't shows that we continue to believe because we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the religion of modern medicine,46 even when it forbids the questions and doubts that true science requires.47 The jig is up .\n\u200bIn any case , a number of signs and portents lead me to prophesy that this topsy-turvy politics may be on the verge of total collapse .\nThe most obvious reason is the sheer aggressiveness of the campaign to enforce the stricter mandates , as if knowing that the end is near .\nA good example is the CDC 's latest agenda item , Healthy People 2020 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults,48 and may well backfire , since having to stand in line and roll up their own sleeves might stimulate parents to think about vaccines in a new way , to walk the talk they now righteously impose on their children .\n\u200bAnother is the sheer number of vaccines that are out there , with all the boosters and multiple vaccines being given together at the same visit , which have meant and will continue to mean more and more casualties , each with his or her own little ecosystem of grieving parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention the skyrocketing costs of medical care and special education in the schools that must follow in their wake .\n\u200bEven though still largely `` under the radar , '' unacknowledged as legitimate or vaccine-related by most doctors , hospitals , schools , and even some family members and friends , the sheer numbers of aggrieved parents convinced that vaccines were responsible have already mobilized a formidable online presence , demonstrated and testified before state legislatures , and even persuaded some of them to leave their religious and philosophical exemptions in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such casualties have also brought about a subtle change in the attitude of and coverage by the news media , including more objective reporting of anti-vaccination protests by nurses refusing to take the flu and Hep B shots that some hospitals are requiring as conditions of their employment,49 which suggests that the religious aspect may slowly be wearing thin and giving way .\n\u200bSimilarly , many of the women asserting the right to control their own bodies , whether by demanding access to abortions and birth control , or by exposing sexual abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have children , and will then have to fight for the right to decide on what kind of health care to give them .\nWhether or not to vaccinate will thus finally , inevitably , and rightly come to be recognized as a woman 's issue , a mother 's issue , and ultimately a father 's , too , one supremely worth demonstrating , protesting , and otherwise fighting for , engaging with politicians about , and even running for office themselves , to make it happen .\n\u200bSo in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spearhead or leading edge for change .\nIf the industry , the CDC , and most doctors are right that vaccines are truly safe , then those thousands upon thousands of aggrieved parents who claim that vaccines have killed or crippled their children and must live every day in the shadow of those tragedies , whatever may have caused them , must be either lying , deluded , ignorant , or stupid .\nHaving cared for many such children over the years , I can attest to the fact that their parents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant `` anti-vaxxers , '' the derogatory term meant to ridicule and defame them , their only mistake was to have done exactly what they were told , and now they want answers -- to learn the truth about vaccines , and to insure that they be made as safe as possible : `` ex-vaxxers '' would be a more accurate label .\n\u200bAfter 52 years of practicing family medicine , I can also say with complete assurance what should have been obvious all along , that caring parents are much better judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those giant multinationals who make and sell vaccines , profit so lavishly from them , and can not even be sued

baby die to sell a $ 35 dollar product , rather than showing existing science to doctors , and telling them that they can do a simple blood test from their birth heel stick to screen for biomarkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurological damage from their products .\nBecause every baby that is screened out before a potential vaccine induced SIDS event is $ 35 dollars out of their pocket .\nMainers have fought earnestly and honestly and should be able to believe that the system would force them to do the same , but as most of even newbies certainly know by now , open fraud is their standard operating procedure .\nWhat parents have done in Maine over the last year has been powerful !\nI talked to the Secretary of State even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he had never seen a seen a reaction to an issue like this in his life in Maine .\nBut the hard reality of this attempt at overturning LD 798 is that it could not work .\nFirst , the people 's veto in Maine does not work on conservative issues .\nThe track record for people 's vetoes in Maine ( which go back to 1909 ) is that the only measures that have passed since the invention of the radio are are liberal causes that the newspapers back .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative cause '' but it is .\nThe only exception to that in the last 80 years is the take down of the gay marriage bill 10 years ago .\nAnd they only won because the Mormon church backed up a truck load of money into Maine and launched a fear campaign .\n( That was Merck and Pfizer 's move this year . )\nOther than that effort , there has not been a `` conservative '' win via people 's veto since 1939 , with the hardly controversial vote on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 1939 Legislature entitled `` An Act Relating to Provide a Police Commission for the City of Biddeford '' be Ratified ? ''\nIf fact MOST ballot issues fail .\nThey are just hard to pass .\nSecond , Pharma has all the money .\nAll of it .\nThey can ( and did ) find 250k each in their couch cushions .\nThey boldly crowed they would simply put a zero on whatever Maine raised to defend itself .\nAnd they could put two or more zeros on that number to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine .\nAnd if they ran out of zeros , they could just call up the Federal Reserve and say , `` Hey , can you just put a few zeros on the end of our bank accounts ?\nKthanksbye . ''\nI was kinda , `` Well , they have to do this cash dump with some sort of discretion , because it would look bad and be precedent setting to actually have individual vaccine makers plop down , let 's say , 250K apiece on a direct ballot measure to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Nope !\nNevermind ! ''\nMerck and Pfizer seemed to literally throw an FU at Mainers and be like , `` yeah ... we just texted each other and grabbed a random number of 250k a piece .\nScrew you ... we do n't even have to hide it and there is nothing you can do to top our financing .\nWe have a lot of couch cushions we have not even looked under yet . ''\nIt was a bold move .\nAnd the very arrogant physician that was the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even , `` Ugh !\nWe have nothing to do with Pharma !\nDo you even know who I am !\nI 'm a DOCTOR !\nHOW DARE YOU !\n*campaign finance report issued* Well actually we do have everything to do with Pharma , but Pharma loves you and offers you a wonderful plan for your life , so it 's all good . ''\nNo shame at all .\nThird , It is unwise to put the rights of an oppressed and hated minority in the hands of low information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forth , It is unwise to put the rights of an oppressed and hated minority in the hands of low information voters being informed by the oppressors .\nFifth , It is unwise to put the rights of an oppressed and hated minority in the hands of low information voters being informed by the oppressors .\nAd infinitum .\nAnd now unfortunately we may have an upsetting coda waiting in the wings .\nNanny Mills and the dems who believe they own your body already have an `` emergency '' vaccine bill written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Boat '' Tipping to now allow online students back into school as long as they never set foot on campus ... not even for graduation .\nThey can simply strip the language out of it , change to whatever they want , run through the same legislature that approved LD 798 in the first place , and in no time flat Maine can be worse off than it was before this campaign was launched .\nThe bill adds things into the mix and declares their horrible law `` ratified '' by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into doing all the footwork for , and paying for , the `` ratification '' of their own downfall .\n`` Maine voted and this is what it wants , '' will now follow every discussion on vaccine exemptions in Maine .\n( and probably in your state ) They can further amend the bill to make things worse , like move up implementation , add Gardasil to the schedule , add teacher mandates , suspend the rules , and pass it under the hammer ... who knows .\nThe No on 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was looking forward to adding adult mandates to the law .\nHonestly , if I were them , and had no conscience , that is what I would do .\nIt is unlikely that they are going to have this chance again , having Mills and both chambers .\nMainers on both sides are quite upset that they are working together to sell off Maine to the highest bidder .\nThe legislative pendulum is primed to swing .\nAnd the Dem party is in trouble nationally .\nSo Maine might not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see what the rest of March brings .\nIn the meantime , to my beloved friends in Maine .\nYou have fought like warriors , many of you are becoming experts , I am proud of how bold you have become , and those who fight in truth and honesty win no matter the outcome .\nYou have made Maine a better place .\nAnd you know what ?\nYou can take whatever they throw at us .\nThis past year has made you into a warrior .\nYou have seen how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just starting to get to know how strong you are .\nIn the last couple of days I have heard from a few exhausted souls ... `` This is my last hope . ''\n`` If this fails we are leaving . ''\n`` I do n't know what I am going to do if ...\nPlease do n't despair !\nDo n't leave !\nNever , never , never , never , never give up !\nThe price of freedom IS eternal vigilance .\nIt is now time to come at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative approaches .\nYou have special teams starting to form that can go after each part of the monster in Maine .\nYou have built , not an army , but several armies .\nYou can now become a diverse fighting force , like the branches of our military .\nYou have trained yourself for war .\nYou know now for a fact that Merck and Pfizer are not simply your `` opponents '' but your `` enemy . ''\nAnd there is more than one way to shut them down .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of their products that you do n't need to stay alive .\nYou can systematically educate your doctors and school boards on a wide variety of information .\nYou will need to put together door knocking teams for our legislative champions , those challenging legislators who would not protect us , and throwing cash at those elected officials who got in front of cameras time after time and acted as your voice to Maine .\nThere are more state government entities to be approached , lawsuits to be filed , media projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shenanigans to be documented , and ideas to be fleshed out .\nWe have many more battles to fight , and the ones that have the best chance of making an impact are still ahead of us .\nIf you are too beaten up after this round , Natasha Suleiman is head nurse over at Health Choice Maine Hospital .\nShe can get you patched up .\nAnd then Health Choice Maine will be suiting up to organize new efforts .\nSo we leave this battle much wiser , and bolder .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/8HMpCAwi6ws/maine-votes-no-on-question-1-by-a-3-to-1-margin-ratifies-new-law-to-remove-exemptions.html", "published": "2020-03-04T04:30:00-05:00", "published_utc": 1583314200, "collection_utc": 1583323415}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-03-05--Action Alert: When #DoctorsSpeakUp Age of Autism Will Speak Out", "date": "2020-03-05", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Action Alert: When #DoctorsSpeakUp Age of Autism Will Speak Out", "content": "Hi , friends .\nI just got an email from John Gilmore of Autism Action Network with a giant call to action on Twitter today , March 5 .\nJoin us on Twitter to fight back , throw facts and photos at , and even laugh at the American Academy of Pediatrics March 5 hashtag # DoctorsSpeakUp .\nSpeak up ?\nAmerican Pediatricians have been DEAD SILENT when it comes to autism .\nThey have no tools .\nNo assistance beyond `` Call early intervention .

Cannot Believe Brian Deer About Andrew Wakefield", "content": "It is also problematic that virtually every public defence of the vaccine programme begins with an attack on the integrity of Dr Andrew Wakefield , as if the public humiliation of one man could provide scientific justification in perpetuity for an entire class of products .\nWakefield has been globally transformed into the Emmanuel Goldstein of public health ( to reference Orwell \u2019 s 1984 ) but we should not mistake that this is actually occurring at the level of propaganda and not of scientific ( or historic ) fact : indeed when people cite Wakefield as an example few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts they are citing , and this has reduced to zero the quality of informed public discussion .\nMeanwhile Wakefield \u2019 s fate serves as a warning to anyone else who might professionally step out of line .\nIn this context I pose the question in what other field of human activity would this means of controlling public discussion and opinion be considered politically tolerable ?\nI also pose the question how we can possibly know the vaccine programme is safe if we control opinion in this way ?\nThis submission is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious disease .\nWhat I am saying is that even though the control of disease is important it is not a good enough reason to stand the rules of research integrity or public discussion on their head .\nFor this reason I have things to say not only about the Wakefield paper but the problematic nature of vaccine science , and also the general exclusion of the subject from contemporary mainstream public debate .\nEven the reasons for going to war at times of national peril are debated , but here it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance to an industry and its public advocates .\nIn these circumstances reasonable comment is driven to the margins with unreasonable , even to the extent of being buried by search engines such as google .\nI am grateful to the committee for the invitation to submit evidence on behalf of Age of Autism .\nThis evidence has been shaped by statements made in the Committee \u2019 s prior publication POSTnote 544 singling out the Wakefield \u201c Lancet paper \u201d as an example of fraud , and particularly in relation to the defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 1 ] .\nIf these statements had not been made I might have presented somewhat different evidence , but in the circumstances it is necessary to address these claims and their underlying assumptions .\nIt becomes particularly relevant in the light the latest campaign , led by Times Newspapers , to further discredit Andrew Wakefield .\nThis is part of evidence I presented to the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Inquiry into Research Integrity in 2017 .\nIt was never published by the Committee but after much argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document , known as POSTnote 544 , so that it did not directly allege that Andrew Wakefield committed fraud by only attributing the claim to British Medical Journal .\nIt is dismaying that we are still having to rebut so many false claims so many years after the events .\nThe publication of Brian Deer 's book is now only a couple of months away from publication , but it has also been sad to see distinguished Danish scientist , Peter G\u00f8tzsche , recycling these allegations in a book of his own .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero because of his stand against SSRI antidepressants ( which are also implicated in autism ) and on the safety HPV vaccines , but when he sides with Deer on the subject of Andrew Wakefield we wonder whether he has on this occasion done due diligence .\nFrom my perspective as an informed observer the Wakefield MMR episode , though much more prolonged , is as shameful as the Kelly WMD episode as an example of how someone might be treated who crosses government policy , but beyond the personal issue what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the political agenda ) .\nIf we turn the spotlight round I have never seen so many people go out of their way to put one man in the wrong in apparently egregious ways .\nThe \u201c outing \u201d of Wakefield by Richard Horton , Evan Harris and Brian Deer in 2004 poses many questions : a basic one might be why the answer of the British establishment to a paper which had stood for six years was essentially the work of the Sunday Times \u2019 s casually employed social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lancet did not retract the paper for a further six years with the findings of the General Medical Council against Wakefield and his two colleagues Prof John Walker-Smith ( its senior author and the senior clinician ) , and Prof Simon Murch .\nWhile a further two years later a High Court judge , Sir John Mitting , in clearing Walker-Smith ( Wakefield not having been funded to appeal ) over-turned the central findings of GMC , particularly in relation to the paper [ 2 ] .\nIf he had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel ) that the paper was based on a putative Legal Aid Board funded protocol , if the reporting had been inaccurate ( Walker-Smith was responsible for the patient histories in 11 of 12 cases ) , if the investigations of the children had been unauthorised or unwarranted then Walker-Smith could not have been exonerated \u2013 nor were Mitting \u2019 s findings challenged by the GMC .\nHowever , Wakefield ( and as it happens Murch ) are left technically guilty of events which never occurred .\nThe paper meanwhile has been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lancet but not evidently an example of fraud .\nThere is much more to say about this history but a High Court review of the evidence , unchallenged by the GMC seems a good place to start .\nAnother thing to remark on was that the \u201c outing of Wakefield \u201d was a public event of potentially extreme prejudice in February 2004 leading the BBC news for near four days .\nJeremy Laurance reported in the Independent [ 3 ] : At the Department of Health , which has striven for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine , joy is unconfined at the discrediting of Andrew Wakefield , as the researcher responsible for the scare .\nSir Liam Donaldson , the Chief Medical Officer , went on television saying [ 4 ] : I do n't think that spin and science mix .\nIf they are mixed , it is a very unfavourable position for children 's health .\nNow a darker side of this work has shown through , with the ethical conduct of the research and this is something that has to be looked at .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went even further endorsing the claims [ 5 ] : There is absolutely no evidence to support this link between MMR and autism .\nIf there was , I can assure you that any government would be looking at it and trying to act on it .\nI hope , now that people see that the situation is somewhat different to what they were led to believe , they will have the triple jab because it is important to do it .\nSuch was the public spirit of these events that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting any further discussion or enquiry an NHS website \u201c MMR the Facts \u201d had linked right away to the website of Brian Deer .\nIt could be said that a lot of jumping of the gun was going on in high places .\nHowever , the story that the public were being told was flawed , not to say impossible : that Wakefield had somehow disguised his involvement in the MMR litigation for the past eight years , that this was not known to the Lancet ( or for instance the MMR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lancet editor , Richard Horton , seemed to have a multiplicity of stories .\nAnyone listening to news broadcasts in that week in February 2004 ( or reading his book on the affair six months later ) would have assumed that he had only just learnt of Wakefield \u2019 s involvement as the result of the Deer investigation , when the fact had actually been published in the Lancet only two months after the paper in 1998 , in a letter from Wakefield .\nIn the letter Wakefield insisted that there was \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper ( a review of clinical cases ) was not affected by the fact that he was being retained by as an expert by the court in the MMR litigation .\nA Rouse suggests that litigation bias might exist by virtue of information he has downloaded from the internet : from the Society for the Autistically Handicapped .\nOnly one author ( AJW ) has agreed to help evaluate a small number of these children on behalf of the Legal Aid Board .\nThese children have all been seen expressly on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( eg , from general practitioner , child psychiatrist , or community paediatrician ) on the merits of their symptoms .\nAJW has never heard of the Society for the Autistically Handicapped and no fact sheet has been provided by them to distribute to interested parties .\nThe only fact sheet we have produced is for general practitioners , which describes the background and protocol for the investigation of children with autism and gastrointestinal symptoms .\nFinally , all those children referred to us ( including the 53 who have been investigated already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends into 1999 ) have come through the formal channels described above .\nNo conflict of interest exists .\nWhen this was pointed out in two newspapers , however furtively - a week after Horton had made the allegation on BBC news - the BBC refused to broadcast a correction .\nI personally contacted the head of BBC news , Richard Sambrook , who told me to contact the Today programme science correspondent Tom Feilden , who ignored a series of emails .\nOne might have thought it was not a small difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict he was apart from anything following convention ( certainly of time and mostly probably subsequently ) that acting as an expert witness did not constitute a conflict .\nThis was pointed out in a letter to The Times by barrister Robert Hantusch ( 24 February 2004 ) : ... the courts do not consider that the engagement of someone to act as an expert witness in litigation has the effect that that person is then biased .\nIndeed , if this were the legal position , no paid professional could ever at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd the same explanation was offered on the other side by Public Health Service Laboratory scientist Elizabeth Miller in a letter to Private Eye ( 19 March 2004 ) : ... there can be no conflict of interest when acting as an expert for the courts , because the duty to the courts overrides any other obligation , including to the person from whom the expert receives the instruction or by whom they are paid .\nIn this regard it is essential to re-visit the evidence given to the Science and Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crispin Davis , the proprietor of the Lancet and CEO of medical publisher Reed Elsevier , being examined on behalf of the committee by Dr Evan Harris ( who had himself accompanied Brian Deer to the Lancet offices less than two weeks previously ) .\nThe exchange went as follows : Davis : At the time of the submission of the article there was no admission of conflict of interest .\nThree months later there was a written letter .\nI think I have got it somewhere here .\nHarris : I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 [ correctly 2 May ] .\nDavis : It actually says , 'There is no conflict of interest ' .\nShould the editor then\u2014 However , this is completely misleading .\nBoth men had Wakefield \u2019 s letter in front of them but no one could guess from the exchange as heard or printed that Wakefield had actually affirmed that he was working for the court rather than having denied it .\nThe position was , in fact , the exact opposite to impression given in the exchange .\nIt should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he was not disguising his involvement but it was not something which by convention constituted \u201c a conflict \u201d , and the position was just the same for him as for countless other \u201c experts \u201d who give evidence and are paid .\nRather more problematic , if Harris and Davis were being hyper-fastidious about Wakefield \u2019 s alleged conflicts they were not being open about their own .\nIn the case of Harris , his father Frank was a Committee on Safety in Medicines veteran who was sitting in autumn 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARVI , when SKB and Pasteur Merieux \u2013 pre-cursors to GSK and Sanofi Pasteur \u2013 had withdrawn their faulty MMR products , Pluserix and Imravax , from the British market , leaving the Department of Health high and dry ( and without having had any advice to withdraw the products from their own committees ) .\nCrispin Davis , on the other hand , failed to mention that he had recently been appointed as a director of GSK [ 7 ] or that his own brother Sir Nigel Davis ( now Lord Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a closed hearing against the MMR litigation continuing [ 8 ] .\nBoth Harris and Crispin Davis \u2013 who had behaved so censoriously about Wakefield \u2013 had major undisclosed conflicts in the matter , which belies their \u201c holier-than-thou \u201d approach .\nHorton \u2019 s fall-back position which was not widely broadcast ( and not even mentioned in his book ) was not hugely plausible either .\nHe wrote in the Lancet ( 17 April 2004 ) : We do not accept Andrew Wakefield and colleagues ' interpretation of the letter published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 , ..which was , in any event , only published 3 months after the original 1998 Lancet paper .\nBut this is stretching a point ( not to mention time ) absurdly .\nThe publication of the letter ( the timing of which lay in the hands of journal ) was not three months but two months ( 9 weeks ) after the publication of the paper .\nThis point became part of the prosecution with the GMC counsel , Sally Smith QC , extending the spurious 3 months to 4 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wording of the sentence you referred to `` only one author that agreed to evaluate a small number of these children on behalf of the Legal Aid Board '' , you say you took that to mean since the publication of the paper and we are now some three or four months on .\nto which Horton replied with a solitary \u201c Yes \u201d ( Day 17 GMC Hearing ) .\nBut Wakefield was responding to a letter dispatched by Dr Rouse two working days after the publication of the paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of publication , so this would have been by no means a competent reading by a senior journal editor .\nIf he got this wrong it was very much his fault , not Wakefield \u2019 s .\nEven after Wakefield \u2019 s letter was published on 2 May 1998 the issue of Wakefield \u2019 s court role did not seem to be controversial with the Lancet , and he was not required to declare it as a conflict in following publications in the journal .\nOnce again it very much looks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have his cake and eat it .\nOn top of this at the hearing Wakefield ( Day 55 ) provided evidence that Horton and the Lancet had been apprised of his position as an expert witness in the MMR litigation by Richard Barr of the law firm Dawbarns in April 1997 months before the paper was even submitted : Barr was requesting the use of copyright material for a fact sheet about the litigation .\nIt is noteworthy that in his statement read to the GMC ( Day 111 ) Horton only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet but not that he read the letter .\nHowever , the conclusion must be that if Horton had searched the Lancet \u2019 s files he could not have made the allegations in the first place in 2004 , which were repeated in modified form under oath in 2007 .\nIf he had acted in this responsible fashion he would just have had to conclude that the journal knew all along .\nNotwithstanding , on his own testimony in the book MMR Science and Fiction Horton was discussing with a GMC official how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the allegations : In truth , they ( the GMC ) had not a clue where to begin .\nAt a dinner I attended on 23 February ( 2004 ) , one medical regulator and I discussed the Wakefield case .\nHe seemed unsure of how the Council could play a useful part in resolving the confusion .\nAs we talked over coffee while the other dinner guests were departing , he scribbled down some possible lines of investigation , and passed me his card , suggesting that I contact him directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed keen to pursue Wakefield , especially given ministerial interest .\nHere was professionally led regulation of doctors in action - notes exchanged over liqueurs in a beautifully panelled room of one of medicine 's most venerable institutions ( p7-8 ) This was another extreme conflict which did not stop him giving evidence at the hearing .\nThe driving force for \u201c the outing of Wakefield \u201d nevertheless came from the Sunday Times .\nIn January 2012 the editor-in-chief of the Sunday Times then ( and in 2004 ) , John Witherow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not engage in fishing [ 9 ] .\nThis in itself seems to be contradicted the investigating journalist \u2019 s , Brian Deer \u2019 s , account of the matter .\nWriting in the British Medical Journal after the GMC findings Deer wrote ( 2 February 2010 ) : For me the story started with a lunch .\nSo many do .\n`` I need something big , '' said a Sunday Times section editor .\n`` About what ? ''\nI replied .\nHim : `` MMR ?\n`` \u2026So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own inquiries .\nOnce again this was a matter vitiated by potential conflict : the editor , Paul Nuki , was the son of Committee on Safety in Medicines veteran , Prof George Nuki [ 10 ] , and by 2007 Nuki junior had moved to a new post as Chief Editor of NHS Choices .\nPaul Nuki accompanied Deer and Evan Harris to deliver their allegations at the Lancet offices on 18 February 2004 .\nOf course , we are not told why Paul Nuki needed something \u201c big \u201d but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the defence of MMR rather than the opposite .\nPossibly , Nuki also had in mind an earlier hatchet job of Deer \u2019 s on Margaret Best , a successful Irish litigant on behalf of her son Kenneth over the DPT vaccine .\nThis would explain why Deer engaged in the practice of blagging , interviewing two MMR litigant friends under a disguised name , Brian Lawrence ( Lawrence was in fact his middle name ) .\nWhen a group of parents , including myself , approached the Leveson Inquiry about Deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 11 ] : -The circumstances in which Deer was hired to conduct a fishing expedition -Deer \u2019 s use of an alias -That Deer had launched a secret series of complaints about Wakefield and colleagues to the GMC while continuing to report as a disinterested party -That Deer received support from MedicoLegal Investigations , an agency affiliated to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ( ABPI ) -That Deer had been able to launch a new wave of allegations against Wakefield in February 2009 immediately following the appointment of the CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr James Murdoch , to the board of GSK with a brief to help protect the reputation of the group .\nWhat transpired was that Lord Leveson allowed News International to veto discussion of these matters in their role in the inquiry as \u201c core participants \u201d although everyone thought they were the main subject of the inquiry .\nThank you for your letter , in response to the points you make the Inquiry makes the following response .\nPrior to your submission being published it is circulated to the Core Participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement being published .\nIn your case , the Sunday Times objected and as stated in my letter the Inquiry Team does not consider it necessary to resolve the differences between your account and the account of events that have been provided by the Sunday Times .\nBy reason of this conflict of evidence on the face of the written submissions , and the fact that the Inquiry will not hear oral evidence on this issue , the Inquiry Team does not consider that it would be appropriate to take your submission as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also once again problematic that both Lord Leveson and Robert Jay QC , the two main legal officers in the inquiry , had been at an earlier stage involved by a remarkable coincidence in denying the claims of the MMR litigants : Jay having represented the Legal Services Commission when they sought to remove funding [ 12 ] , and Leveson down the line having upheld the never published findings of Sir Nigel Davis [ 13 ] .\nOf course , there was no point in appealing to the self-appointed watchdog Hacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it boasted Dr Evan Harris as an a director and adviser [ 14 ] .\nLeveson was by no means even handed .\nWhile the behaviour of the Sunday Times and its journalist lay well within his brief the issue of the reporting of science scarcely did , which did not stop him taking evidence from Fiona Fox of the industrial lobby organisation Science Media Centre or taking time once again to condemn Wakefield as a maverick scientist in his first report .\nIt is a troubling idea that unethical journalism against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government policy .\nAlso interesting to note that when the Department of Business set up a committee to consider the future of science journalism in 2009 ( which in itself could be a disturbing idea ) Fiona Fox was placed at the head with members Paul Nuki \u2013 who hired Mr Deer - and Martin Moore , who was to become chair of Hacked Off [ 15 ] .\nRegarding the Deer investigation , Mr Deer states on his website ( and has stated for a long time ) [ 16 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Deer 's MMR investigation , almost all of the key facts and documents are not public domain , and , such is the culture of plagiarism , he will act against authors who represent his writing , interviews , documents , or other research , as the fruit of their own inquiries , whether referenced or not .\nThe problem with such a statement is that not only should he not have such documents \u2013 ie private medical and legal documents \u2013 we only have his word for what is in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in BMJ Rapid Responses [ 17 ] : I know the names and family backgrounds of all 12 of the children enrolled in the study , including the child enrolled from the United States .\nseveral letters responding this declaration were removed following \u201c a legal complaint \u201d [ 17 ] as well as the mild comment of Dr F Edward Yazbak , a board registered paediatrician in the United States : I must say I am troubled that Mr Deer was able to obtain the names and family backgrounds of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Deer had published several of the names on his website prior to the GMC hearing against the doctors .\nIt does not seem to help that Mr Deer was being aided by a member of both the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee and British Medical Association Ethics Committee , Dr Evan Harris MP .\nWhile this might have added a veneer of respectability to the Sunday Times allegations Dr Harris \u2019 s presence could by no means make it legal .\nThis remains a question for Dr Harris .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BMJ it may be pointed out preluded the further publication by the BMJ of Mr Deer \u2019 s allegations in January the following year .\nIf the BMJ had acknowledged these concerns rather than having them removed it would have embarrassed them further down the line .\nThat Mr Deer was assisted by MedicoLegal Investigations ( an agency affiliated to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ) was attested by a report on their website at the time of the investigation .\nMLI executive Peter Jay states in their March 2004 newsletter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advise on matters that were clearly quite alarming .\nIt is rewarding to know that our knowledge and understanding of research problems is recognised .\nThe history of Deer \u2019 s hidden complaints is well covered in a Spectator blog by Melanie Phillips [ 18 ] .\nThe first of Deer \u2019 s complaints to the GMC , unknown to Sunday Times readers at the time , was launched just three days after the first of his articles .\nThis was a position the GMC lawyers seemed happy to cooperate with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public his role , disguising the fact that he was actively stoking a legal process when he had a vested interest in the outcome , while allowing him to continue to report on the story .\nAt the GMC hearing I was witness to one receptionist telling another that Mr Deer did not sign the visitor \u2019 s book .\nWhatever his status Deer was the only person who complained , and whose complaints were brought forward .\nPhillips \u2019 s article also highlights the fact that on Deer \u2019 s own testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine court for their autism Omnibus hearing , to which they would not otherwise have had access .\nOn 3 February 2009 the Guardian reported that James Murdoch had been appointed to the board of GSK with an income of \u00a375,000 a year with a brief [ 19 ] : \u2026to help review `` external issues that might have the potential for serious impact upon the group 's business and reputation \u201d Just six days later the Sunday Times unleashed a new wave of Mr Deer \u2019 s allegations ( later re-cycled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further five attacks on Wakefield \u2019 s integrity appearing in News International publications in the following week [ 11 ] .\nIt is obviously troubling that a media mogul could be enlisted to help protect the reputation of a pharmaceutical company .\nEqually troubling is that a government inquiry set up to protect the public from the media should have allowed News International to veto these lines of inquiry .\nMy correspondence with the committee has covered the subsequent re-cycling of Mr Deer \u2019 s allegations in 2011 , when the journal labelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited by the committee [ 1 ] .\nThe claims made were problematic in many respects .\nThe editorial which made this claim was signed by Dr Harvey Marcovitch who was simultaneously head of GMC panels .\nEven though this was disclosed it surely belongs to the category of conflict which should be avoided altogether .\nDr Marcovitch was also apparently , it emerged , the single \u201c external \u201d peer reviewer of Mr Deer \u2019 s articles which were published as being \u201c externally peer reviewed \u201d despite being an associate editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own commercial conflicts receiving advertising revenue from MMR manufacturers GSK and Merck , or that its Learning division received unrestricted grants from Merck [ 1 ] .\nFrom the start BMJ were very defensive about Mr Deer \u2019 s data analysis .\nThe BMJ had failed to recognise Mr Deer was basing his interpretation on GP records which were not available to the authors of the paper ( or that he did not have access to the children \u2019 s Red Books , which were ) .\nThey were also obstructive about publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children \u2019 s records .\nMatters came to head in November 2011 when a leading US whistleblowing scientist Dr David Lewis submitted an article to the BMJ which showed among other things that the paper \u2019 s disputed reporting of the biopsy slides had been truthful .\nThis led to the BMJ \u2019 s editor in chief , Fiona Godlee , Mr Deer and their expert advisor , Prof Ingvar Bjarnason making significant admissions in Nature News [ 1 ] .\nIt also put Dr Godlee in a quandary .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the papers \u2019 histopathologist co-authors , as they had been in letters from them to the journal \u2013 and not somehow cooked by Andrew Wakefield on his own \u2013 perhaps the time had come to go after them too .\nThis was a questionable way to proceed given that Dr Lewis had also produced documentary evidence that readings were properly founded .\nIt was in these circumstances that she apparently wrote to then chair of the Science and Technology Committee , Andrew Miller , asking for the committee to do this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting cold feet - and Miller wrote back on behalf of the committee declining to be involved .\nYou also indicate concerns about the broader questions of whether or not UCL adequately investigated the roles of all those who put their names to Dr Wakefield \u2019 s papers and whether there was pressure to minimise any investigations in order to protect the institution .\nThese relate to the integrity of the academic institution as a whole and are not simply an issue of whether or not the institution promotes \u2018 good science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a body such as HEFCE , which has the task of ensuring academic standards in publicly-funded bodies .\nI believe one thing to recognise about all this is how prejudicial it is .\nWhen Dr Godlee , on the face of it , finds that one reason for disregarding the validity of the paper fails , she ends up looking for another one : the possibility that it might have been sound in first place can not be considered .\nShe could not simply accept that she was mistaken , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic thing to do .\nBy this stage there seemed to be an awful lot more wrong with the attack on Wakefield \u2019 s paper than anything in it .\nHot on the heels of these events at the end of 2011 came the High Court hearing for Dr Wakefield \u2019 s co-defendant at the GMC , Prof John Walker-Smith and his exoneration .\nIt is necessary to understand that Prof Walker-Smith was both the lead clinician and the senior author in the paper , for which reason the central case against Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case against Prof Walker-Smith , who had been globally the leading pioneer in the field of paediatric gastroenterology for three decades .\nThe failed claim of Mr Deer and the GMC was that the Lancet paper , which was published as \u201c an early report \u201d was an ill-conducted version of a Legal Aid Board funded research protocol 172-96 , rather than simply a review of clinical cases seen on the basis of referral , albeit some of the parents may have contacted Dr Wakefield prior to their referral .\nThis was partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker-Smith had moved his department from Barts ( where he had practiced since the early 1970s ) to the Royal Free in 1995 , but it was certainly the correct place to refer unusual cases .\nAt the GMC the panel stated in its findings [ 13 ] : The Panel has heard that ethical approval had been sought and granted for other trials and it has been specifically suggested that Project 172-96 was never undertaken and that in fact , the Lancet 12 children \u2019 s investigations were clinically indicated and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered by Project 162-95 .\nIn the light of all the available evidence , the Panel rejected this proposition .\nAnd this was exactly what was dismissed by Mr Justice Mitting [ 13 ] : Its conclusion that Professor Walker-Smith was guilty of serious professional misconduct in relation to the Lancet children was in part founded upon its conclusion that the investigations into them were carried out pursuant to Project 172-96 .\nThe only explanation given for that conclusion is that it was reached \u201c in the light of all the available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was an inadequate explanation of the finding .\nAs it may also have been reached upon the basis of two fundamental errors \u2013 that Professor Walker-Smith \u2019 s intention was irrelevant and that it was not necessary to determine whether he had lied to the Ethics Committee , it is a determination which can not stand unless it is justified by the detailed findings made in relation to the eleven relevant Lancet children .\nSo , we are left with the remarkable situation that after two and half years of hearings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , if any , that led them to their conclusion .\nIndeed , at the High court hearing a further two years on the GMC \u2019 s counsel having failed once again to identify what this evidence was prevailed on Judge Mitting to see whether he could find any , and he could not .\nThis helps to explain why the GMC never took the matter to the Court of Appeal , and it remains anomalous that these disproven findings remain against Dr Wakefield and Prof Murch : that they remain technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have occurred after three years of investigation and two and a half years of hearings .\nThat , however , is somewhat typical of this history .\nOf course , this does not cover all the findings against Dr Wakefield but it poses a fundamental question about the spirit in which the hearings were conducted and specifically covers the issue of whether the paper was \u201c a fraud \u201d .\nAs I have already written to the committee the case that the paper was a fraud took a final beating in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Kingdom Research Integrity Office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to pursue an in inquiry [ 1 ] .\nBefore leaving the topic of the GMC hearing there are some other troubling matters to visit .\nOne was that as we have seen the GMC and its lawyers had played a deception on the public by allowing it to remain undisclosed that the principle journalist reporting the matter was also the only author of complaints brought forward by the GMC against the doctors .\nAnother issue was that the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship of Prof Dennis McDevitt who had sat on the government \u2019 s vaccines \u2019 adverse reaction committee ARVI when it had failed to advise the removal of the SKB Pluserix vaccine before the manufacturer finally decided to remove it from the British market \u2013 ARVI being a sub-committee of Committee on Safety of Medicines ( CSM ) which advised medical licensing authority the MCA ( which later became the MHRA ) and the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation ( JCVI ) [ 20 ] .\nWe have seen that Prof Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris , also sat on this committee .\nThe Pluserix issue has been a continuing embarrassment to the Department of Health because when it was introduced in 1988 the manufacturer had already withdrawn it by agreement in Canada , pending investigation , following reports of mumps meningitis .\nThe United Kingdom market was likely being offered up to SKB ( a then non-British company ) in its forthcoming merger with Beecham ( the merger with GlaxoWellcome followed in 2001-2 ) .\nMeanwhile , the NHS as purchasers of the Pluserix signed an indemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( later GSK ) was sued .\nWhen Prof McDevitt withdrew after press enquiries he was replaced by Dr Surendra Kumar whose background was not known to the defendants .\nIt emerged only after the hearing had commenced that Dr Kumar had sat on the CSM in 1996-9 ( Day 3 ) and was presently on two MHRA committees and owned shares in GSK ( Day 101 ) although the CSM itself was no longer in existence .\nShortly after the hearing was finally over in the summer of 2010 Dr Kumar demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association debate calling for the MMR to be made compulsory [ 21 ] .\nIt is necessary to consider what was involved here .\nIn the first place if the GMC had been playing straight they would surely have replaced Prof McDevitt with somebody who did not have similar conflicts .\nBut it was also impossible to do anything about it once the hearing had commenced unless it was to be abandoned and started all over again , which was a hugely unattractive prospect .\nIt should also be borne in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Health entirely funded by the pharmaceutical industry .\nIn 2005 report House of Commons Health Committee reported [ 22 ] : \u2026The regulator , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , has failed to adequately scrutinise licensing data and its post-marketing surveillance is inadequate .\nThe MHRA Chairman stated that trust was integral to effective regulation , but trust , while convenient , may mean that the regulatory process is not strict enough .\nThe organisation has been too close to the industry , a closeness underpinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequent contact , consultation and interchange of staff .\nWe are concerned that a rather lax regime is exacerbated by the MHRA \u2019 s need to compete with other European regulators for licence application business .\nSo judgment was coming from a source clearly aligned with government policy , and evidently the GMC did not want it to come from anywhere else .\nAnother issue was the apparently illegal transfer of documents from the MMR litigation by Legal Services Commission ( formerly the Legal Aid Board , and currently the Legal Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers for the purposes of the hearing .\nThe LSC had sought to end the MMR litigation in 2003 around the same time that Brian Deer was approached by the Sunday Times and Paul Nuki to find something \u201c big \u201d on \u201c MMR \u201d but some of the cases \u2013 not associated with autism \u2013 lingered on till 2007 , just before the GMC hearing .\nThis transfer was prohibited under the Medical Act of 1983 .\nAfter many enquiries I was passed on by the GMC to their lawyers Field Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 2012 : We are instructed by the General Medical Council ( GMC ) , who have forwarded to us your email of 2 August 2012 to Mark Ellen about the legal basis on which GMC issued and served a notice on the Legal Services Commission ( LSC ) pursuant to Section 35a of the Medical Act 1983 ( as amended ) .\nThis notice was issued by the GMC as part of its fitness to practice proceedings against Dr Wakefield , Prof Walker-Smith and Dr Murch .\nWe acted for the GMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for this reason that the GMC have asked us to respond direct to you in answer to your query .\nThe existence of section 38 of the Legal Aid Act , to which you refer , was raised with us by LSC when we first approached them with a request for information .\nIn consequence , advise from counsel was sought who advised that it should be possible for the LSC to provide information to GMC within the ambit of the exemption provided under section 38 ( 2 ) which permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a summary or collection of information so framed as not to enable information relating to any particular person to be ascertained from it \u201d .\nThis was put to the LSC and it was under this basis that the notice under section 35a was issued and served .\nSomeone has signed in hand \u201c Field Fisher Waterhouse \u201d but no officer of the firm is identified or gives their signature .\nIt is evident that section 38 ( 2 ) of the Legal Aid Act may have enabled the Legal Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case without disclosing anything of legal consequence or breaching confidentiality , and this would not have been useful to the GMC prosecution ( where in fact whole documents naming people were read out ) .\nThe inference would be that when ( as apparently happened ) the Legal Services Commission provided material which well exceeded the limitations of section 38 ( 2 ) of the Legal Aid Act the GMC and their lawyers should have returned such material as provided in error , rather than used it in the proceedings .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal , and a breach of the rights of the litigants , it left Dr Wakefield having to try and answer questions on matters to which he had never been party , as if he was responsible for them .\nClearly , this should not have happened , and on the face of it is a case of monumental executive abuse ... .\n[ 3 ] Jeremy

.\nYou can win this argument on all the other autoimmune diseases.\n\u2019 NO !\n\u201c We \u2019 re talking about one in 36 , and now we know that \u2019 s probably 25 percent short of where we \u2019 re at !\n\u201c And I just thought , ONE IN 250 , if only , if only that was the issue .\n\u201c What really hit me when I was watching it the other day , [ Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in 250 children , this is the fastest growing epidemic of our lifetime .\nNo money is going into it .\n\u2026 Back in 2002 the autism rate was , according to Burton , one in 250 children .\nDel showed a clip of a congressional hearing run by U.S. Representative Dan Burton from 2002 where he grilled officials on the use of mercury in vaccines .\n\u2018 Are we going to one in 29 with autism and nobody \u2019 s talking about it ?\nJust looking the other way ?\n... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re now preparing for the new numbers .\nThey \u2019 re preparing us .\nThey \u2019 re saying , well we better let them know that we \u2019 ve been missing by 25 percent so when we ramp it up , we need an excuse for why we just went from one in 36 to , what \u2019 s it going to be , 25 percent ?\nAre we going to one in 29 ?\n\u2018 Now take a look at this study .\n\u2026 \u2018 A quarter of kids with autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Well this study just came out , remember we \u2019 re at one in 36 with autism in New Jersey which I would assume would be the case for just about the entire county.\u2026 \u201c We watched the [ Who Health Organization ] scratching their heads on vaccine safety science ; now a new study is even more terrifying .\nWe keep hearing that autism was always here , it \u2019 s just being diagnosed better .\nDel \u2019 s Jan 21 , 2020 interview with political economist , Dr. Toby Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToby is a researcher who has looked at the science and added up the cost of what autism will do us .\nThere is nothing to celebrate during April , Autism Awareness Month .\nThe economics of autism will bury us .\nOur Anne Dachel has transcribed the January 21st , 2020 interview between Del Bigtree and Dr. Toby Rogers .\nShe is a gem , more precious than a 12 pack of mega-roll of Charmin ... .\nRogers ' thesis at The University of Sydney ( Australia ) was titled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five years ago I started my PhD \u2026and I was dating an Australian woman who has a young son , and in July of 2015 he was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum .\n\u201c At first I was in denial .\n\u2026I spent one day researching autism .\nI went to the CDC webpage on research on the causes of autism .\nThey have several different arguments : that autism is genetic , perhaps it \u2019 s about older parents , \u2026 \u201c The CDC website goes to great lengths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines and autism .\nThey have fifteen sources or so there , so I went and looked up all the original sources .\n\u201c I was shocked and stunned .\nThere \u2019 s no proper unvaccinated control group.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s troublesome because everybody knows that if you \u2019 re going to do good science you have to have a double blind , randomized control trial , and the CDC has none of that .\n\u201c I was troubled by the fact that the CDC doesn \u2019 t have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 15 percent every year for almost forty years now .\n\u201c It can not be the case that the most important public health agency in the country doesn \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re talking about when it comes to the autism epidemic .\n\u201c So I did a second day of research and a third , and I did everything I could to defend them , to try to find some sort of evidence that they knew what they were talking about .\nAnd it \u2019 s just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks reading about autism .\nI was also curious , as a political economist , as to whether there are any good cost estimates out there .\n\u201c It seemed to me that with rising autism prevalence , you \u2019 d also see rising autism costs to society , and it turns out , the costs are catastrophic.\n\u201d \u2026 Del asked Toby why he ended up focusing on the societal cost of autism .\nToby : \u201c When I began this work I didn \u2019 t think it would become my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocently enough .\nI was just going to spend one Saturday researching everything I could about autism.\n\u201d Toby then recounted how he has read the New York Times every day for twenty years and noticed the fact that every couple of years there would be a story about the rising autism prevalence .\nWhat he found missing in their reporting was anything about the cost of autism .\nToby described the reaction to his autism research at his university .\n\u201c All I wanted to do was read the evidence for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , the oldest scientific society in the world , is \u2018 Nullius in verba , \u2019 take nobody \u2019 s word for it .\n\u2026 \u201c So I set out to do the work for myself , I read the evidence for myself , and what the CDC was saying did not check out .\n\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s bewildering .\nYou feel like you \u2019 re losing your mind .\nIt can \u2019 t be possible that the most important public health agency in the country , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story that doesn \u2019 t match the data on the page .\n\u201c I kicked the tires every different way to try to prove myself wrong for six weeks on end , twelve hours a day , pouring over the material on the page , the actual scientific evidence about what \u2019 s happening , and it just didn \u2019 t check out .\nWhat the CDC was saying simply didn \u2019 t check out .\n\u201c Evidently I had to have a conversation with my supervisor and say , \u2018 Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis on Adam Smith , but I \u2019 ve stumbled into this extremely important story that I hadn \u2019 t expected to stumble into.\n\u2019 \u201c As you can imagine that was a difficult conversation because nobody wants to take this topic on because everybody knows that there \u2019 s all sorts of pushback that \u2019 s going to come from the pharmaceutical industry , from the chemical industry , from big energy companies .\nPeople were afraid , so the conversations were difficult .\n\u201c To their credit , my department stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented what I had found so far to my supervisor , and I said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t know , I don \u2019 t know if we should keep going because the politics ahead are rough for all of us , \u2019 and he said , \u2018 No , you are on to something that \u2019 s important.\n\u2019 \u201c You and I might disagree on some facets of this , but I can help guide you to do this research in the right way.\n\u201d \u201c The University of Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney are old school .\nThey do things by the book .\nThey do things in the right way thorough , meticulous , documenting every point , references .\nI have a hundred and twenty-five pages of references in my finished doctoral thesis .\nSo we had difficult conversations , but eventually they said , \u2018 Please continue because this is an important topic.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c So I spent the next four years studying and reading everything that \u2019 s been written on the science of autism .\nI read every vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 \u201c I was just stunned by what I found .\n\u201c In 2015 , autism cost the United States $ 268 billion .\n\u2026And they project that if autism continues at its current rate , that autism will cost the United States one trillion dollars by 2025 .\n\u201c The first wave of vaccine injured kids are aging out of the school system and they need adult residential care .\n\u201c And there is no plan at the federal level or at the state level for how to manage this wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , autism is going to cost the United States more than the U.S. Defense Department budget .\n\u201c This is a tsunami of costs that are already here , and yet , government isn \u2019 t talking about it .\nPoliticians don \u2019 t talk about it .\nAnd they continue to be engaged in denial .\n\u201c When I went into this research I was a true believer in vaccines , but after four years of work , the truth of the matter is the vaccines that on the market today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharmaceutical industry is engaging in smoke and mirrors and junk science .\n\u201c They haven \u2019 t been tested for safety .\nWe \u2019 re expected to accept them on faith .\n\u201c The U.S. has two choices : We can enter a pharma dark ages , or we can engage in autism prevention .\n\u201c Those are the only two choices on the table .\n\u201c The levels of suffering out there are unbelievable .\nWe know how to stop this epidemic .\nWe have a moral responsibility as a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE DON \u2019 T WE \u2019 RE LOOKING AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .\nThe conversation between Del and Toby continued .\n\u201c You believe this could lead to the collapse of the financial strength of America .\nAnd you \u2019 re talking not just talking autoimmune disease and all the issues around vaccines , JUST AUTISM .\nToby : \u201c There are three cost studies that really matter .\n\u2026 \u201c The first is a study in 2012 [ from the University of Pennsylvania ] .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families .\nAnd as you can imagine the cost of autism for families is enormous\u2026.\n\u201d Toby explained the disparities in income for parents with an autistic child .\n\u201c Autism plunges families into poverty , and it increases inequality in society.\n\u201d \u201c In 2014 we have another study , and this study was by the London School of Economics together with the University of Pennsylvania .\nThe lead author on that is [ Ariane V.S . ]\nBuescher .\n\u201c Buescher found two things that are really important for this conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism and an intellectual disability , they \u2019 re looking lifetime care cost of $ 2.4 million per child over the course of a lifetime .\n\u201c If they have autism with no intellectual disability , they \u2019 re still looking at $ 1.4 million in lifetime care costs .\n\u201c Some of these costs are picked up by government , some of them are picked up by private insurance , but families are picking up the bulk of these costs .\nThat is an enormous burden on families .\n\u201c One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an interview said that autism cost the U.K. more than heart disease , cancer , and stroke combined .\nIt is the most costly medical condition in the U.K. , and yet , politicians aren \u2019 t talking about it .\n\u201c That \u2019 s strange , and that \u2019 s weird .\nThat needs to be explained , and that \u2019 s one of the things I did in my doctoral thesis .\n\u201c The final study I want to mention is a study in 2015 by Leigh and Du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cost to U.S. society of autism .\n\u201c They calculated that in 2015 autism cost the United States $ 268 billion and they projected that if autism continues at its current rate , we \u2019 re looking one trillion dollars a year in autism costs by 2025 , so within five years .\n\u201c Just to put this in perspective , the U.S. Defense Department budget consumes 3.1 percent of gross domestic product , GDP .\n\u201c By 2025 , autism is going to cost the United States 3.6 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Department cost .\n\u201c So we have this tsunami of costs that are here already that are happening , and you have no discussion of it at the federal level , no discussion of it at the state level , no discussion of it in the New York Times or the mainstream media .\n\u201c It is a weird story that I was trying to unpack .\nHow is it possible that we \u2019 re in the midst of this epidemic , and government has no plan for how to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and meet with elected officials and talk to them about my research , I say to them , \u2018 We have a choice , we can engage in autism prevention , or we can continue on our current course and the United States will collapse from these costs within the next fifty years.\n\u2019 \u201c But when I meet with elected officials and I talk about autism prevention , it is the first time they \u2019 ve ever seen the words AUTISM and PREVENTION put together in the same sentence .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s relatively straightforward .\nWe actually know what to do to start to bring these numbers down .\n\u201c These politicians who want to gaslight us and ignore us , and act like if they just ignore us long enough , we \u2019 ll go away .\n\u201c The fact of the matter is , that work that you \u2019 re doing , that Bobby Kennedy \u2019 s doing , Mary Holland \u2026Lyn Redwood \u2019 s .\n\u201c Politicians need the answers we \u2019 re coming up with .\n`` We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic chemical out of children 's bodies that 's going to lower autism rates , and politicians are going to need these answers and they 're going to come asking for these answers pretty soon , I would think . ''\nDel asked if Toby thought vaccines were the sole cause of autism .\n`` So in my research I look at the regulatory history of five classes of toxicants that increase autism risk .\n`` The CDC has this narrative about what 's going on .\nThe CDC narrative is completely untethered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in science and it 's not based in the reality of the scientific data .\n`` In my research I went and looked and said , 'Do we have good studies on toxicants that increase autism risk ? '\n`` And we do .\n`` There 's a basket of five factors , toxicants that increase autism risk .\nSo it 's mercury from coal powered power plants and diesel trucks .\nIt 's the ingredients in plastics , it 's pesticides and herbicides ...\nIt 's MEF and RFR , cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceuticals .\nThere are three pharmaceutical products that we 're worried about in particular Tylenol , SSRI antidepressants , and vaccines ... .\n\u201c We have good data on all these toxicants .\nThese are big studies , respectable researchers , statistically significant results , large sample sizes .\nSo we know that these five factors increase risk .\n\u201c These five factors create the total toxic load on children , but not all these factors are equally harmful .\n\u201c With the first four factors\u2026that \u2019 s sort of the background condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and often trigger regressive autism\u2026 .\n\u201c We have five very good studies that I point to that show vaccines increase autism risk .\nThe birth dose of Hepatitis B seems particularly problematic .\nWe have two studies , Gallagher and Goodman did a study in 2008 and 2010 that showed the birth dose Hepatitis B increases autism risk .\n\u201c We have Dr. Paul Thomas and his book the Vaccine Friendly Plan , he \u2019 s able to reduce autism rates in his practice by 90 percent .\nBut if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get even further gainsas far as reductions in autism .\n\u201c We have the two Mawson studies that came out in 2017 that were one of the first vaccinated vs unvaccinated studies which shows unvaccinated kids are much healthier , and they have fewer chronic illnesses .\n\u201c \u2026I think it \u2019 s all relatively straightforward to know what to doto begin to bring down these autism rates .\nWe need to better regulate or ban toxic chemicals from going into kids \u2019 bodies .\n\u201c \u2014In my doctoral thesis I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asbestos , lead and tobacco .\nSo these are viewed as regulatory success stories , but in my research I showed that it takes a hundred years , a hundred years , to go from KNOWN HARMS\u2026TO ANY SORT OF REGULATION OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE .\nThat \u2019 s how long the regulatory process takes .\n\u201c WE DON \u2019 T HAVE A HUNDREDS YEARS WHEN IT COMES TO AUTISM .\nWE NEED TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS AUTISM PREVENTION THROUGH KEEPING CHEMICAL OUT OF CHILDREN \u2019 S BODIES .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c What we \u2019 re starting to see at the state level , and we need to see more of this , is that some elected officials are starting to wake up .\nWe \u2019 re moving from not just beating these bad bills but moving towards good bills .\n\u201c I think what we \u2019 re going to see at the state level is that some state is going to embrace the sort of research that I \u2019 ve done that show that if we can keep these toxic chemicals out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see reductions in autism rates .\n\u201c And they \u2019 re not going to wait for the federal government to wake up , they \u2019 re not going to wait for the CDC to do the right thing .\nThey \u2019 re going to move immediately because they \u2019 re seeing the cost of autism in families , in communities and in their states .\nSo some governor , some politician is going to move a bill to regulate these toxic chemicals .\nAnd what \u2019 s going to happen is within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal in the data , and we \u2019 ll know that this indeed was causing a rise in autism prevalence .\nThen we can adopt best practices nationwide .\n\u201c So as difficult as the fight is right now I think the way forward is relatively straightforward \u2026 \u201d Del asked Toby what the average person out there should do .\n\u201c Families , parents need to evaluate the evidence for themselves .\n\u2026Don \u2019 t defer and contract out your decision making and your brain to some authority because we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are supposed to be protecting us are captured .\n\u201c The problem here is regulatory capture .\nSo the regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting us are actually protecting the pharmaceutical companies\u2026 \u201c Two things need to happen .\nOne , we have to do something about regulatory capture both at the federal and state level .\nWe have to just ban financial conflicts of interest\u2026 .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this large literature on what \u2019 s called the funding effect .\nThe funding effect looks at how financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the literature shows is that any financial contribution from a pharmaceutical company\u2026 changes research outcomes \u2014 literally changes the data.\n\u201d Del then challenged those who say the safety studies have been done on vaccines .\n\u201c \u2026Vaccines are getting no safety studies against placebos .\nWe now know there are no surveillance systems that anyone really trusts\u2026 \u201c Del asked Toby about the denials from so many experts and officials .\nThis was his response : \u201c \u2026The regulators , the scientists and the politicians who continues to choose not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired sound bites that they hear from the pharmaceutical industry or lobbyists\u2026 \u201c Is it willful ?\nDo they know that they \u2019 re being untruthful ?\nI think capture happens in a lot of ways .\nThere \u2019 s financial capture\u2026 There \u2019 s other kinds of capture\u2014what they call cultural capture .\nI think these people live in an information bubble .\nThey only talk to people who think like them .\nThey only read news sources that think like them .\n\u201c In my thesis I look at how capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science itself .\nBasically from the moment a student sets foot on a medical school campus , all the way through his or her career until retirement , they \u2019 re living in an information bubble .\n\u201c Pharma shapes what \u2019 s in the textbooks , they give consulting gigs to their professors , the chair of the department has a consulting gig with the pharmaceutical company , the university is invested with Johnson & Johnson or Bayer or Merck or one of those big companies .\n\u201c And then they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines are written by a committee that \u2019 s filled with pharmaceutical industry types .\nStandards of care are written by the pharmaceutical industry .\nAnd then they pick up the New York Times and they \u2019 re not talking about a crisis or an epidemic or anything like that .\nAnd so they live in this information bubble , and it \u2019 s really comfortable in that information bubble , right ?\nThey \u2019 re well paid , they \u2019 re well respected , they \u2019 re looked up to in society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get such pushback is because we present evidence that sort of pierces that information bubble and it \u2019 s painful .\n\u201c Your research is brilliant .\nI commend you on taking a look at this .\nIt \u2019 s terrifying.\n, perhaps more terrifying because those of us who aren \u2019 t suffering at home \u2026 it \u2019 s coming for us .\nIt \u2019 s going to affect every pocketbook and the future of the nation and the world.\n\u201d \u201c The more we can talk about this , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , the more we can have hard conversations about the science , about the risk , about what \u2019 s happening with kids\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s untenable to continue down the current path we \u2019 re on where all these toxic chemicals are allowed into children \u2019 s bodies\u2026 .\n\u201d", "author":

there to be fired , and I was .\nIt took about fifteen minutes , and they explained that these things had gone on , and that I was expressing personal opinions that went against the policy of the organization .\nTherefore I was being let go .\nSome people read my blog and my comments and made a report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sharing these things .\nSome even said they were afraid of me .\nMaybe I wasn \u2019 t taking this seriously , therefore I would infect other people and make them sick with my presence .\nI got a feeling for how people were being affected by the news .\nPeople were very much taken in by the fear , by the hysteria , and by that date Sitka had zero confirmed cases , and now , even as of this date [ April 4 th ] , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were terrified and are terrified .\nI looked at the numbers\u2014I can use a calculator .\nI looked at the numbers and I thought , yeah we \u2019 re blowing this way out of proportion .\nPaul and others have said it too .\nI put that out there as a blog , and I said this looks like something else is going on .\nI shared that on a local Sitka , Alaska , Facebook forum , and I received a whole lot of negative comments about it .\nI quoted Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend in the vaccine informed community , but he had come out and said we \u2019 re really not very good at evaluating risk .\nWe \u2019 re blowing this way out of proportion .\nAnd so the purpose of the blog was to talk about what looked like an unfolding agenda and how this thing was being blown way out of proportion .\nI have no idea where this was caused , who brought it out , whether it was natural or whether it was manmade , or what country it started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything like that .\nI don \u2019 t anything about that , but I do that there \u2019 s a history of bad people , criminal people , that take these things , these events and they turn them into something else .\nThere \u2019 s an agenda involved , A couple of weeks ago I put out a blog about COVID19 and the COVID19 PSYOPS , and I made it very clear that I don \u2019 t even anything about COVID19 .\nI \u2019 m not a medical professional , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne Dachel I recently talked with Brett Wilcox , a long time advocate for personal choice when it comes to mandatory vaccination .\nHe has written and spoken extensively on the subject .\nFor taking the position he has , he has paid a personal price , the loss of his job .\nInteresting about this : the previous day , April 1ST , that was Wednesday , I posted another blog on the subject called The Cure , in which I talked about the history of pandemics in a different way .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria and the propaganda .\nI talked about that in terms of being a pandemic , a pandemic of delusion that led to very bad outcomes .\nI talked about how that spread around the world .\nI talked about how sad it is that medical professionals are now locked in a system that is dysfunctional , demoralizing , and where they can \u2019 t really even talk to their patients about natural means of promoting health .\nThey \u2019 re there to sell pharmaceutical products , and if they don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped .\nIt \u2019 s a very sick system , and I caught the brunt of that sickness the next day when I went to work and had been fired .\n\u2026One of the big differences between COVID19 and previous pandemics is the level of hysteria that \u2019 s really taken this to a whole new level .\nI just wanted to say that it \u2019 s always been in the vaccine world , we \u2019 ve all been taught that the healthiest children among us who are the unvaccinated children are little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vaccinated .\nAnd somehow we are indoctrinated to believe that these unvaccinated kids are disease bombs and everywhere they go , they \u2019 re going to explode their diseases all over the vaccinated people , which doesn \u2019 t make any sense because if the vaccines worked they would have nothing to worry about .\nThe PSYOPS involved in COVID19 is that now we \u2019 ve been taught that everyone is a disease bomb .\nIt \u2019 s totally changed our psychology , the way we feel about ourselves , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we socialize .\nIt will forever change how we feel about our own species .\nWe will view each other with greater suspicion , with hostility , with paranoia , our anxiety will go through the roof , our depression will go through the roof .\nBecause of all the economic fallout from the shutdown , which is immense , we \u2019 re going to be experiencing all the things that go along with poverty .\nWe \u2019 ll have increased violence , we \u2019 ll have increased addiction , increased self-harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of this global shift in the way we feel about ourselves and the crushing economic situation in which we find ourselves now .\n[ The blog ] on April 1st was called The Cure , and in it I started out and explained World War II from a different perspective .\nI said that this was not so much a war between nations but it was a pandemic disease that struck Nazi Germany particularly hard , and this disease deluded the people into believing that they were a special , superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public safety .\nThey practiced social distancing and isolation and quarantine to protect themselves from their Jewish neighbors .\nEventually the result was the Holocaust .\nFollowing that we had Nuremberg that at least in theory was meant to kill off this pandemic .\nIt didn \u2019 t work because many of the most afflicted of this disease travelled around the world and set up their homes in Argentina , the United States , where they were employed as scientists and they had special value in the pharmaceutical industry because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , torturing and killing little girls and boys , men and women in the concentration camps .\nThis disease then also spread out to the medical schools where medical professionals were taught that toxic formulations from the pharmaceutical industry was the only thing they could prescribe to help their patients rather than teach them how to work with nature to strengthen their immune systems and extend their longevity and have peace and happiness and all that .\nNow we \u2019 re in this situation where we \u2019 re repeating the same type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we \u2019 re living with fear , we \u2019 re living with hysteria .\nPeople used to rat out their neighbors in Nazi Germany and now people are ratting out their neighbors in the U.S .\nThere are people calling the police and say , \u2018 I need to report there were people not living in fear.\n\u2019 I learned yesterday there \u2019 s actually fake police officers going around saying you need

regarding vaccine industry corruption , I would invite you to go to our store , take a look at our leggings and hoodies and jackets and jewelry and bags and those things .\nAny purchase that you make

protect our health and the health of our loved ones from coronavirus .\nThe team at Children \u2019 s Health Defense decided to write an article about Dengue Fever because an important part of medicine \u2019 s body of knowledge comes from the opportunity to learn from past mistakes .\nDengue fever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries and , like Coronavirus , has been the target for a vaccine for many years .\nThe development and licensure of Dengvaxia\u00ae vaccine by Sanofi spanned more than 20 years and cost more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars .\nBut the development of the vaccine turned out to be tricky .\nDengue vaccine antibodies can also make the infection worse , especially in infants and children who have never been exposed to the virus .\nThe virus may actually use the antibodies

.\nDespite the fact that Sanofi tested Dengvaxia in several large clinical trials with more than 30,000 kids globally and published the results in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine , there were serious problems .\nAccording to epidemiologists who reviewed the data , the trials were riddled with \u201c small inaccur\u00adacies , missing data , and uncalculated risks.\n\u201d Buried

investigation by the Public Attorney \u2019 s Office .\nThe vaccine has been permanently banned in the country .\nWhat is also very concerning is that even after Dengvaxia led to tragic injuries and deaths in the Philippines , the FDA moved forward and licensed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a May 1 , 2019 press release , the agency granted the application Priority Review under a program intended to encourage

SUBMISSION in the subject line .\nWe review all submissions before publication .\nBy Cees J. Hamelink Seated with the five children around the dinner table in the summer of 1957 my father presented us with a puzzling observation .\nHe said when the Good Lord had created all the animals he decided to create one more .\nThis one would walk upright and would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then our father added , \u201c Children that is what He should not have done because He created a weird species \u201d .\nI often think of his comment in the bizarre days we presently go through .\nWe could have seen this coming .\nWe could have known that one day in whatever form Mother Gaia , whom humans had made very angry , would retaliate .\nBut we preferred to be not prepared , busy as we were running together towards our extinction .\nAll the signs were there but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of the upcoming car .\nThe weird species is now hastily cooking up all kinds of beautiful scenarios on how different the post-corona world will be .\nWe offer each other generously pseudo-philosophical reflections about how beneficial this period is for us , how we turn to our inner selves , and how we focus on the here and the now .\nFew dare to say that what is now called the \u201c new normal \u201d is not normal at all .\nWe are social animals and not made for life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and huggers .\nIt seems to me a mistake to believe that we will act in fundamentally different ways after the pandemic .\nIn her great study on human history \u201c The March of Folly \u201d , Barbara Tuchman showed us that humanity does not learn from its own mistakes .\nWe do not have the moral courage to face mistakes and change course .\nThe international community made a solemn promise after World War II : \u201c Never again !\n\u201d .\nThe ink of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again to kill each other massively .\nOf course , there are worldwide moving and encouraging signs of cooperative behaviour but that is always the case in moments of great catastrophes .\nThe weird species does indeed have an altruistic side but it is a thin line that separates this from our selfish genes ( Richard Dawkins ) .\nEven if one does not expect that fundamental transformation towards a more human world is a realistic option , we may still learn from this global epidemic .\nIt is conceivable that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most nasty characteristics : the weird species is an arrogant species .\nArrogance is our most evil problem : white is better , male is better , rich is better , human is better than animal , private is better than public , winner is better than loser .\nOur obsessive arrogance seems to me to be the result of our ontological anxiety .\nWe are the only species that knows life leads to death but we do not know when and how the sentence will be executed .\nIn particular news media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .\nFor the first time in history millions of people can watch simultaneously stories of fear and crisis .\nFor global audiences the media create a world that is dangerous and in which things may be getting worse .\nMedia do not create people \u2019 s sense of risk and danger but they amplify the disposition to expect that things will work out the wrong way .\nOur deepest worry may be that the human being is the most useless animal on the planet .\nThat we are expendable and that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not matter .\nIf we become extinct we will be the only species that will mourn our demise .\nWe are morally not better or worse than non-human animals and yet we are so arrogant !\nEspecially in our relation with the earth system .\nHumans are the leading force in killing other species at a rapid rate .\nHumans may -as the most powerful species \u2013 think of themselves as the centre of the planet but are increasingly unable to control it .\nIt is debatable whether , as Pope Francis states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our Common Home ; encyclical Vatican , 2015 ) \u201d nature is our loving sister \u201d .\nClive Hamilton may have better cards when he writes in \u201c Defiant Earth \u201d \u201c Now when Mother Earth opens her arms it is not to embrace but to crush us \u201d .\nHamilton argues that we no longer have to save nature but we should save ourselves from nature and from ourselves .\nThe interesting conclusion is that we are not any longer free to treat the Earth as we please .\nOur enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we no longer can choose between dominion or stewardship .\nWe must understand that the forces that were expected to bring us more freedom , more equality , and more civilization also brought disruption of the earth system , lethal arms systems , unprecedented ubiquitous surveillance and a tweeting culture that effectively erodes whatever minimal deliberative social processes we had developed .\nMaybe the corona epidemic manages to confront us brutally with this human arrogance .\nI deeply admire the healthcare people but how little do they know !\nThe medical profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and big labs it does not know how this virus did originate , how it spreads and how it can be cured .\nA smart virus has beaten us on all scores !\nWe have no medical answer , but equally no psychological , paedagogical , economic or moral-philosophical answers .\nWe do not really understand how to deal with the pressures that the current crisis confront people with .\nHow to cope with a social distancing , when physical contact is a biological necessity ?\nHow to live without the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain by direct contact with others ?\nAnd , arguably the most pressing concern is about children : citizens of post-corona societies .\nDid we sufficiently test -against the interests of children- , all the measures that governments propose , such as lockdown strategies ( a.o .\nthe closure of schools ) , the social distancing ( a.o .\nthe prohibition to visit grandparents ) , the surveillance initiatives , the stress caused by the constant media reporting on dying people , and the belligerent public discourse that focuses on \u201c the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \u201c the front lines \u201d ?\nMost of the measures , however well intended , would probably not stand up against the provisions in the International Convention on the Rights of Children .\nThis is actually a much broader issue as most of the government measures around the world amount to restrictions of fundamental human rights .\nAmong the rights that are violated are the right to family life , the right to education , and the right to assembly .\nGovernments have an obligation to respect the rights of individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this obligation is subject to limitation clauses which means that governments may derogate from their \u201c obligation to protect \u201d if this is strictly required by the national situation .\nAmong the basic conditions for a permissible limitation of fundamental rights are an official declaration of the state of emergency and a notification of this state to the pertinent international bodies and other states party to the relevant legal instrument .\nIt is also required that there are judicial guarantees for a regular review by national courts of law.This is somewhat problematic since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be- tend in emergency situations to loyally follow instructions of their governments .\nIt is essential that restrictions of human rights must be justified by demonstrating pressing social needs .\nIt is at this point that we need to seriously look at how governments justify their Corona prohibitions and the fines and arrests they impose for those defying these prohibitions .\nAt present I do not see governments offering solid arguments based on scientific evidence for their measures .\nJustification seems to be primarily based on televised virological babbles and their echo-chambering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking the place of a transparent , democratic exchange of different views .\nEven if these get a lot of popular support they do not justify limiting people \u2019 s fundamental rights .\nI do think that our arrogant claim to superior knowledge stands in the way of the much needed critical inquiry and dialogue .\nA major scientific finding of the 20th century has been to discover how little we know and that most of our scientific inquiries are not driven by knowledge but by ignorance .\nAnd yet , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that we are the single proprietors of the ultimate truth .\nThis allowed us to deal with other opinions in very condescending ways .\nIt is possible that once confronted with the limits to our knowledge we may realize that criticism of those who take alternative routes ( for example in medicine ) and raise fundamental questions about accepted wisdom ( on such issues as for example vaccination ) should be based upon more certainty than we presently have .\nThe acceptance of our failures also opens up the possibility for moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not need moral guidance .\nIt is precisely in the weaknesses of the human condition that we need to reflect on the moral choices we make .\nOur current situation can be summed up \u2013paraphrasing Merleau Ponty- in this metaphor : Together we are in a dense fog on our way to a goal that we do not know and that may not be there .\nOn the way we do n't know what we are doing and do what we do at random .\nWith this ignorance it would suit us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and to the confused discourse of the world .\nThis way we can walk together towards a world where people can interact in humane ways .\nWe will have to walk towards that world in the company of a weird species .\nMaybe my father was right but the Lord , or the blind watchmaker or genetic evolution decided otherwise and so the best we can do is to walk together ( holding hands as soon as this is allowed again ) with the other members of our weird species .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , that we are genetically disposed to selfish behaviour .\nHowever , early in our evolutionary history we discovered that hunting for game and especially big game had its own specific requirements .\nCoordination and cooperation were absolutely essential for the fitness of the group of hunters .\nEven more important than cooperative hunting was sharing the meat which was a source of good feelings and positive socializing .\nEfficient cooperation was good for all members of the group and therefore it paid off to encourage generosity .\nAlthough there seems -today- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition and greed than for sharing and altruism , the global youth rebellion- with iconic figures such as Greta Thunberg , may be an important sign of changing times .\nThe good news is that we can learn altruistic behaviour : we have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth as Richard Dawkins wrote .\nThe good news is that ( as Charles Darwin proposed ) we can rise above our origins and can extend positive feelings to all human beings.The good news is that this weird species is the @ @ @ @

Parliament yesterday forwarding the excellent letter to the UK 's Secretary of Health and Social Care , Matt Hancock ( pictured with Bill Gates ) , by Robert Verkerk and Damien Downing : I must further point to the anomalous position of Prof Pollard , board member of the Jenner Foundation , head of the Oxford Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chair of the JCVI .\nWith the eruption of Kawasaki like symptoms in children with COVID-19 I was recently forced to note that Pollard 's Bexsero Meningitis B vaccine , according to the manufacturer 's data , may cause Kawasaki Disease in as many as 3 in 1,000 children [ 5 ] .\nPollard was not only lead developer of the vaccine but recommended it for infant use at his second meeting as chair of the JCVI [ 6 ] .\nI take the view that it is not so much Prof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the government , who evidently find this continuing situation expedient .\nWe know so far that the Porton/Oxford vaccine will not be tested against genuine placebo [ 7 ] , so we start in bad place .\nIt is absolutely essential if we are going to have these products that the state operates by some conventional rules and this manifestly is not presently happening .\nPlease will you communicate my concern to the Secretary of State .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/JETSHMzgMjM/a-letter-to-my-member-of-parliament-.html",

with autism are merely the result of never-ending better diagnosing by doctors and greater awareness by everyone else .\nCoronavirus coverage dominates the news currently .\nThe only stories about disabled/autistic children involve how they \u2019 re dealing with the pandemic .\nLost in the current crisis was the seemingly unnoticed update of the autism numbers at the end of March from one in

factor , most likely older parents .\nThere were several disturbing reports that should have warranted at least a fraction of the coverage that the current virus does because the long term effect of what \u2019 s happening to children will have an immense economic impact as well .\nInstead , when it comes to autism , we continue to be lulled into believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acceptance .\nLeading autism researcher Dr. Walter Zahorodny received the most minimal coverage ( only the Rutgers University student newspaper ) warning everyone that autism is indeed a crisis with looming consequences .\nRutgers researchers said in a federal report on March 26 that autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) continues to be more prevalent in New Jersey among 8-year-old children than in other states , according to a Rutgers Today article .\nResearchers monitored ASD prevalence of 11 states participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADDM ) Network in 2016 , the report said .\nThe autism prevalence rate for New Jersey was approximately 1 in 32 , or 3.1 percent , compared to the ADDM average , approximately 1 in 54 , or 1.85 percent .\nASD prevalence across states increased 10 percent since 2014 , the report said .\n\u201c Since 2000 , when the ADDM Network was started , overall autism estimates increased 175 percent , \u201d said Walter Zahorodny , an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Since 2000 , New Jersey ASD estimates have been consistently higher than in all other participating states .\nFrom 2000 to 2016 , autism prevalence in New Jersey increased from 1 percent to 3 percent , a 200 percent increase.\n\u201d \u2026 He said it is ultimately not known why autism prevalence has increased , but better awareness and an increase in underlying environmental risk factors are likely at play .\n\u201c Autism is a significant lifelong developmental disability , and so a large and broad increase that is not understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Zahorodny said .\nMeanwhile the mainstream press called for celebration , awareness and

''\nThank you to our Anne Dachel for transcribing excerpts for our readers .\nAnne says : \u201c One of Gates \u2019 vaccines is the Moderna vaccine , which is the first one out of the gate .\nThe Moderna vaccine is a really dangerous human experiment .\nIt \u2019 s shockingly reckless .\nAnd to particularly go forward without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went right to phase one human trials .\n\u2026 \u201c Tony Fauci has arranged for that company , Moderna , which has never produced a vaccine , \u2026which was on the verge of bankruptcy , 1.5 billion dollars in debt , \u2026 .\n\u201c And Gates , who has been funding it , and Fauci rescued the company from bankruptcy by giving them the first of these projects .\nThe project is an RNA vaccine , which has never been made before .\n\u201c What an RNA vaccine does , unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a piece of the target virus , a disabled piece , and an adjuvant which shocks the body to increase the immune response .\nThat \u2019 s how every other vaccine works .\n\u201c This is an experimental technology that has never been done before in history .\nWhat is does , it injects a snippet of the virus that carries a genetic code in its RNA that is designed to alter the DNA , the code in every cell in your body to get your body to naturally start producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of genetic engineering .\nIt is genetic engineering .\nIt has been condemned by the Geneva Statement because those genetic changes will survive in your sperm and they will live in your children or in your ovaries .\n\u201c They are injecting human being with an untested gene-altering technology designed to change the human genome , without having any proof that it actually works .\n\u2026 \u201c There \u2019 s a problem with COVID vaccines that requires that they have to be tested , and that problem is called paradoxical immune enhancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened .\nAfter the SARS epidemic in 2002 , there were three SARS epidemics .\nThe first one was a natural one that began in China .\nThere were two that were lab escapees .\nAnd that \u2019 s not controversial .\nPeople acknowledge that .\n\u201c After those epidemics the Chinese and western nations all get together and they said we \u2019 ve got to develop a vaccine to treat coronavirus , SARS was a kind of coronavirus .\n\u201c They got together and they developed about thirty different vaccines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey tested them on ferrets which are the animal that is most analogous to human reaction to upper respiratory infection .\nThey \u2019 re very similar to humans .\nThey \u2019 re very predictive of what \u2019 s going to happen in human beings .\n\u201c The ferrets developed to all four vaccines an admiral immune response .\nThe scientists thought they hit the jackpot .\n\u2026 \u201c Vaccines are never tested in the field .\nThe FDA never gives 2,000 people a vaccine and 2,000 people a placebo and says go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens .\nThat never happens .\n\u201c The way vaccines get a license is the promoter of the vaccine , the company , injects a couple thousand people with the vaccine and then they test their blood to see of they develop an antibody response .\n\u201c The ferrets developed a picture perfect antibody response , so they all thought they hit the jackpot .\nThen something horrible happened .\n\u201c When those ferrets were later exposed to the wild virus , they all had body wide inflammation in all their organs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then remembered something .\nThey remembered that in the 1960s , the FDA and NIH had tested an RSV vaccine which is very similar to corona virus .\n\u2026They had skipped animal studies and they had gone right to humans .\nThey had tested on 35 kids .\n\u201c The kids again developed a sterling antibody response , so they thought they hit the jackpot .\nBut when those children were exposed to the wild virus , instead of protecting them against it , the vaccine actually enhanced the pathways of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all became horrendously sick .\nIt became a scandal and they dropped it and never touched it again .\n\u2026 \u201c The corona virus does something interesting when it provokes the antibody response .\nThere are two kinds of antibodies .\nThere are neutralizing antibodies which are the kind that defend you from disease .\nThere \u2019 s another kind of antibody called a binding antibody that actually helps the virus stick to your receptors and it makes it much , much more dangerous .\nThat \u2019 s the kind that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in 2012 and they completely terminated the program .\n\u201c Then in 2014 Tony Fauci had developed a dengue vaccine , and in the clinic trials for the dengue vaccine they saw some of the same signals .\nThat actually the people who got the vaccine and then later were exposed got very sick .\nThey glossed over that .\n\u201c They gave it to the Philippines , the Philippines gave it to 100,000 kids .\nMany , many of those kids , when they finally encountered the wild dengue virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died .\n\u201c The Philippine government today is criminally prosecuting the Philippine health officials who waved that vaccine through .\nThey should have known that Fauci in the clinical trials had seen these signals previously .\n\u201c So today , all the people on this panel \u2026the people who \u2019 ve been our loudest critics : Peter Hotez , Paul Offit , Ian Lipkin , all of them are vaccine developers , all of them are bullhorns for the vaccine industry , the generals in the mercenary army that has been fighting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS INSANELY DANGEROUS FOR TONY FAUCI TO GO AHEAD WITH THESE TRIALS to inject human beings .\n\u201c He started on March 12th injecting human beings in Seattle , Washington , volunteers who I \u2019 m sure had no idea that their genes were being permanently altered for generations .\nThere \u2019 s no informed consent because I guarantee you Tony Fauci didn \u2019 t tell them that .\n\u201c He \u2019 s testing his vaccine that he put almost a half a billion dollars into , authorized our taxpayer funds going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patent , of half the patent , and Bill Gates \u2019 vaccine .\nTo fast track this very , very dangerous vaccine without animal studies is reckless and I would say is criminal .\n14:35 Dr. Tenpenny : \u201c During the period of time that they were doing those dengue vaccine trials , I was following that pretty closely .\nThe thing that is even more scary than what you said , \u2026and you from your legal perspective , I would like you to add to this , is we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act that was tacked onto the tail end of a defense appropriation bill at 11:20 at night on Friday night December 17th after everybody in the House had already signed off and gone home .\nThe Senate never read it .\nThey passed it .\nEven your uncle Ted Kennedy said afterwards , \u2018 We judge how well the pharmaceutical company usually wins around here , and they usually get big wins , but they \u2019 ve never gotten a win this big.\n\u2019 \u201c And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those documents now .\nI wrote my book Fowl\u2026about the bird flu , and all of that is in my book .\nI \u2019 ve captured that , and if you try to go find that stuff on the Internet now , \u2026all of it has been scrubbed .\n\u201c What does the Prep Act actually do ?\nIt gives liability immunity for any covered countermeasure that \u2019 s made while it \u2019 s in place .\nYou can \u2019 t sue them .\nThe only way you can sue them if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you have to go to the U.S. Attorney General and prove willful misconduct , that they were going to intentionally going to create a product intentionally to harm you or kill you .\nGood luck with that .\n\u201c Alex Azar , our great HHS Secretary , instituted the Prep Act on February 4th , he put it in there , and he put it into the Federal Register on March 17th , so we are operating under that now .\n\u2026 \u201d 16:43 Kennedy : \u201c Bill Gates said from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow any of his vaccines to be used unless he got full immunity from all from all the governments in all the countries that use his vaccine because he knows he \u2019 s going to kill a lot of people .\nHe himself said this vaccine is only going to be tested on at most only a thousand people.\n\u201d \u201c What if there \u2019 s an injury rate of one in 10,000 ?\nYou won \u2019 t see that if you test a thousand people .\nYou will never see it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a death rate of one in 10,000 .\nVery , very possible , and you will never see it .\nIf you give that vaccine to seven billion people , which is what he \u2019 s intending , that means the 700,000 people are going to die from it .\n\u201c Ultimately you will get to a level where with other injuries etc .\nthat you \u2019 re causing more problems than you \u2019 re averting .\nIt \u2019 s very , very possible .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humans and you test a thousand humans , plus there \u2019 s no placebo , but they don \u2019 t care .\nThey \u2019 re under the Prep Act , complete , blanket immunity from liability .\n\u201c They could end up killing every person they give this to in Seattle .\nWhat do they care ?\nIt \u2019 s a gamble for them because if that Moderna vaccine works Gates is going to make a billion dollars .\nAnd if it doesn \u2019 t work , he \u2019 s got eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll just say that was a bad experiment .\n\u201c The reason they \u2019 re going forward so quickly with that is because there \u2019 s no biological material .\nYou don \u2019 t have to manufacture anything .\nWith other vaccines you have to start a factory , you have to grow the vaccine\u2026 It \u2019 s a long process , but with the Moderna vaccine your body becomes the factory because you \u2019 re altering the human DNA so that it will produce the antibody .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to take little snippets of the RNA and inject them into human beings and let you do all the work .\nThey can fast track it overnight .\nThey can literally get it to market within months , and that \u2019 s what they did .\nWithin weeks , all they needed was that genetic code from the Chinese and they can make this RNA virus .\n\u201c It \u2019 s never proven in any model , and the company that \u2019 s making it has never brought a product to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through phrase three trials and they were on the edge of bankruptcy .\n\u201c It is really , really , really crazy .\nHow willing they are to play God .\n\u2026Gates\u2026believes is up there and he can experiment with lesser human beings .\nIf there \u2019 s collateral damage , then so be it .\nHe \u2019 s well-intentioned , and he \u2019 s going to save the world\u2026.\n\u201d 20:48 Dr. Buttar : \u201d When you introduce RNA into the body , the implications aren \u2019 t something that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month .\nIt could be a year or two years and then the generational component , because now it \u2019 s actually changing the genetic code , and it \u2019 s going to be something that \u2019 s going to stay consistent and continue to propagate generation to generation .\n\u2026 \u201d 21:18 Bigtree ; \u201c One of the studies we were looking at , I believe it was the Moderna study , they are forbidding sexual intercourse without full protection , meaning they are so concerned .\nThere can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , meaning they are so concerned that they may have a generational problem\u2026 \u201c I think one of my biggest concerns when I talk about this , I think Bobby , you put it perfectly , I believe this is the God vaccine .\nWe \u2019 re talking about no longer letting the body react\u2026 We \u2019 re talking about messaging RNA .\nWe \u2019 re talking about putting in manmade messages that go to all of your cells to make the cell think it \u2019 s getting information from the DNA\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe do know that they are all focused on this antibody immune enhancement issue that you very well described .\nThe animals all died in the trials and now we \u2019 re going on to human beings .\n\u201c This is what Hotez sat before Congress and talked about .\nEven Tony Fauci said on television there is a concern that this vaccine could make people more sick .\nWe don \u2019 t want to do that .\nBut the most troubling thing about it that most people don \u2019 t understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a vaccine works , and even more so , what Dr. Peter Hotez said .\nWe don \u2019 t know why antibody immune enhancement happens .\nWe don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s causing it .\n\u201c So my concern is that in these small test groups that they \u2019 re doing\u2026 what happens if let \u2019 s say \u2026 one of these vaccines gets to one of these small trials and for some reason antibody immune enhancement doesn \u2019 t happen .\nWhat I want to say is that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been a bacteria or a virus outbreak that took out the species .\n\u201c There \u2019 s something about nature and our relationship to it that we survive .\nWe even get stronger as we go along .\nWe \u2019 re talking about a vaccine that \u2019 s being discussed by world leaders , being driven by Bill Gates saying everyone in the world is going to get this vaccine .\n\u201c Can you imagine a vaccine that gets to the trials , looks like it \u2019 s safe ... ?\nTheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nAnd then all of a sudden , maybe the strain that they design the vaccine around avoid that problem , but all of a sudden there \u2019 s a mutation \u2026gets out and starts triggering antibody immune enhancement .\n\u201c Now all of a sudden , we \u2019 re not watching .1 percent of the people die , .3 percent or 10 percent .\nYou could talk about a scenario with 30 percent of those coming in contact with what would have been a cold , like those ferrets , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re having complete organ failure and shutdown .\n\u201c You could honestly be looking at a vaccine for the first time that has the potential to eradicate our species .\nThat is how dangerous this vaccine is .\n\u201c \u2026I \u2019 ve been interviewed like crazy .\nI say of all the times we have never put two of the most dangerous words together known to man , RUSHED and SCIENCE , in the same sentence , is the most dangerous statement that could ever be made .\nAnd we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the most dangerous approaches to vaccines there has ever been .\n\u201c This is the message that everyone really needs to share with everyone they know .\nThis is not a joke .\n\u2026This thing is coming for us .\nI can \u2019 t imagine anything more ridiculous than a life-threatening vaccine that has an issue that they don \u2019 t even understand why it happens for an illness that kills .1 to .3 percent of the world.\n\u201d 25:43 Kennedy : \u201c CNN did a really interesting article that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last couple of paragraphs they interviewed two of the former officials , people that worked at Moderna till 2018 and one of them was , I think , the CEO of the company .\n\u201c He said , I was shocked when I read that the federal government had given that company $ 438 million .\nI was shocked .\n\u201c The other guy , and he said , I don \u2019 t know what they were thinking of .\nThat \u2019 s what he said .\nThis is a guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guy was their chief chemist , the head of all their chemistry department , \u2026He said , there is nothing what could make me put that vaccine in my body.\n\u201d 27:00 Dr. Wakefield : \u201c There \u2019 s an extraordinary interview by Peter Aaby .\nPeter Aaby I \u2019 ve known for many years , a very , very good vaccinologist , works for a vaccine maker\u2026 He \u2019 s worked in West Africa for most of his professional life .\nHe said in that interview , we think we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a very , very honest man and he went up against the system and then demonstrated looking at the non-specific effects of vaccines .\nThe DTP vaccine had killed more children in West Africa than it had saved from the target diseases\u2026 And that is the most widely used vaccine historically in the world .\n\u201c An astonishing admission and it was completely ignored .\nThe only response from authorities was to remove his funding .\nWe really live in an era when we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The same happened with pertussis .\nI remember that Salzberg [ Forbes ] wrote an article blaming anti-vaxxers for the outbreaks of whooping cough .\nThere was an admission by Christopher Gill from Boston University [ Dept of Global Health ] saying that we \u2019 ve made assumptions upon assumptions .\nWe didn \u2019 t understand how pertussis interacted with the human immune system .\nWe \u2019 re in the embarrassing position of having to admit that we may have made some serious mistakes .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s the hubris as someone pointed out of the pharmaceutical industry and the vaccinologists .\nThe idea that you can exert dominion , you can mutate , you can adapt , you can change these things\u2026 You can assume dominion over organisms\u2026 .\nThey mutate at an extraordinary rate because they are destined to survive .\nThey will survive\u2026.\n\u201d 29:30 Dr. Tenpenny : \u201c Andy , years ago at a conference\u2026you said , \u2018 The human race has evolved because of its relationship with microbes , not in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and I \u2019 ve used that a lot , and I \u2019 ve always given you credit .\n\u2026 It \u2019 s so true .\n\u2026 \u201c Suddenly we \u2019 ve got mandatory vaccination right here in people \u2019 s faces that first of all never even heard of it , and second of all never gave it any thought .\nPerhaps this is going to give some clarity and some eye-opening to the whole concept of the germ theory too .\nThat it \u2019 s really about the terrain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from getting sick .\nSo maybe there will even be some changes in that .\n\u2026 Maybe people will start to understand our relationship with microbes , and it \u2019 s not all bad.\n\u201d 30 : 50 Dr. Wakefield : \u201c I think that the people who have been telling that story from whatever part of the spectrum of biology that they come from\u2026 Those who have been telling that story as the truth emerges are the ones that in the future are going to be trusted by the people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c What everybody is talking about , I think the most crucial component is that\u2026it \u2019 s now being censored .\n\u2026That \u2019 s the question we should be asking , why is this being censored .\nIt was after your uncle was assassinated , Bobby , that term \u2018 conspiracy theory \u2019 was coined to throw people off from asking those key questions .\n\u201c One of the questions we should be asking \u2026is why is information regarding this and a certain type of technology being censored .\nThat in itself sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026To me one of the most important is , why is information being censored ?\n... \u201d 35:40 Dr. Wakefield : \u201c Del gave an outstanding interview in the new movie on this issue of censorship , and it \u2019 s something that \u2019 s really perplexed us in terms of releasing the movie .\n\u2026 \u201c As all these traditional platforms are disappearing for the kind of story we \u2019 re telling , even those two doctors from mainstream medicine in southern California talking about the facts of COVID the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of censorship , is that we are going out on a new platform , a censorship free platform , SPHIR.IO which provides a specific platform for this very conversation , this growing community .\n\u201c I would strongly recommend to people that we focus on a platform such as this to regroup \u2026to have a censorship free environment in which people can disseminate this kind of information .\n\u2026 36:36 Charlene : \u201c The biggest lobby\u2026 is not oil , it \u2019 s actually the pharmaceutical companies .\nThey spend more money buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other lobby in D.C. \u2026 \u201c I think that people are finding us and they \u2019 re learning how to find us .\n\u2026They took us off Pinterest completely because we told the truth about vaccines and we had a pretty big presence there .\n\u201c We have close to 2,000,000 collectively on Facebook .\nThey \u2019 ve told us we can not even run a sponsored ad to reach new people with the opportunity to learn the truth about vaccines because what we talk about does not marry into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective\u2026 .\n\u201c We \u2019 re all having issues reaching the people of the world in the conventional ways that we have done .\nGoogle took us completely down .\n\u2026 \u201d 42:50 Dr. Tenpenny : \u201c The pro vaccine people , if they really believed what they \u2019 re talking about and they really have faith in what they \u2019 re doing and they trust their science , they \u2019 re missing a great opportunity to put all of us on the stage together somewhere .\n\u201c Wouldn \u2019 t Peter Hotez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heel of their boot on the throat of Sherri Tenpenny and just crush her publicly in front of everybody ?\n... \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t they love to have the opportunity to publicly embarrass us and shame us because they \u2019 re so right and we \u2019 re so wrong ?\nIt should speak volumes to people who hear that.\n\u201d 43:35 Dr. Buttar : \u201c In 2006 or 7 I was in Verona , Italy .\nI was invited by the government of Italy\u2026 I was one of the keynote speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last lecture as a keynote and the other person\u2026 it was Offit .\n\u201c What happened , it was beautiful actually because he started showing some of my slides and half-truths to the point that I got agitated .\nThere were three doctors that had to come and hold me back .\nI was so livid .\nIt was going to be a physical altercation .\n\u201c Some woman stood up in the audience and started yelling in Italian .\n\u2026She \u2019 s screaming and Offit had this look on his face .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bottom line was one of the neurologist there had started using our protocol for their child who was 12 years old at the time .\nAfter six months the child had started to speak and no longer had to wear diapers .\n\u201c She was cursing Offit and he didn \u2019 t know what was being said .\nHe had a smile on his face until he put on headphones , \u2026people started clapping and I realized that the truth will be known .\n\u2026 \u201c I realized they don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 \u201c Vaccines are designed by the way our bodies work , to create immunity .\nGreat concept .\n\u2026But now you \u2019 ve got to start introducing things into the body under the pretense of public safety that suppressing the immune system and giving additional things that are immuno-suppressive and are irritating the immune system \u2026it defies all logic .\n\u201c Why are we doing this ?\nI \u2019 m not against vaccinations , if you can make something that \u2019 s not going to hurt a person .\nBut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt a person more than the original disease that they \u2019 re worried about ?\nIt \u2019 s just madness.\n\u201d 49:24 Kennedy : \u201c I \u2019 m all for vaccines if they can make them safe and effective .\nI \u2019 ve never seen it happen before .\n\u2026 \u201c Part of my job is to try and bring in people into this movement who are not part of the choir .\n\u2026 \u201c You don \u2019 t build a movement starting from a position , I hate all vaccines ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telling audiences I \u2019 m for vaccines , never for mandatory vaccines .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s a vaccine that \u2019 s good for me , it has no bad side effects , and does everything that it \u2019 s advertised to do .\n\u2026I would of course take that vaccine .\nI just haven \u2019 t seen it happen .\n\u201c One of the primary tools of our opponents is to characterize us all as anti-vax .\nThe mainstream of our country and of the world believes all the propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times and CNN can convince someone that you \u2019 re anti-vax , they then have a license to shut you up and to marginalize you and to discredit you and to not listen to what you are saying .\n\u201c I try to open up all the opportunities and possibilities for people to listen to me .\n.. \u201c I \u2019 m against bad science .\nI \u2019 m for good science .\nI \u2019 m for robust science and for honest regulators .\nWe don \u2019 t have any of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good vaccines that are effective and safe , if they can ever be made .\nThe problem is nobody \u2019 s ever done it yet.\n\u201d 52:02 Bigtree : \u201c \u2026 One of our biggest complaints is that the pro vaxxers keep saying the science is settled .\n\u2026That \u2019 s the least scientific statement you can possibly make .\nThat \u2019 s why I don \u2019 t say I \u2019 m anti vaccine .\nThat \u2019 s the same as saying my science is settled , nothing will ever happen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat makes you an idiot , and that makes you unscientific .\n\u201c \u2026I \u2019 m not anti-science .\nI \u2019 m pro science\u2026 I think it \u2019 s perfectly noble to protect people who are at acute risk from COVID 19 with a vaccine .\nHere \u2019 s my problem .\nMy problem is the vaccine should be designed for people that need it .\n\u2026 \u201c Ninety-five percent of the people will have no issue with this illness whatsoever .\nThey \u2019 re going to have a robust immune reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that need it .\nWhat we can not allow any longer is this idea that science only knows how to make a product that ninety-five percent of healthy people can take but not the immune suppressed , not those that are in danger .\nThat is such an obvious advertising marketing scheme , you \u2019 ve got to hand it to them .\n\u2026They want the rest of us \u2026to take a product we don \u2019 t need\u2026 .\n\u201c Go ahead , make the vaccine .\nYou are capable .\nI am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and all the funding coming from Bill Gates , you are completely capable of making a product for that tiny percentage of people that really do need it\u2026.\n\u201d 55:46 Dr Buttar : \u201c I want to say one thing and that is I have publicly stated that I will go anywhere on the planet , no matter how rampant the issue is .\nI will shake their hand , I will hug them , and if she \u2019 s good-looking enough , I \u2019 ll even kiss her .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 55:50 Charlene : \u201c That \u2019 s the point of our discussion right now .\nWe want to learn the truth about vaccines , the truth about COVID .\nWhat \u2019 s really going on .\nIn a free society we ought to be afforded the right to speak and to be heard , to dialogue back and forth .\nThere are talking points that keep people triggered from even listening to us because the term anti vax is somewhat like the term conspiracy theorist .\n\u2026 \u201d Next the panelists each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n58:49 Dr. Wakefield : \u201c \u2026The new film comes out in a few weeks time .\n\u2026It \u2019 s called 1986 The Act , and it goes right to the core of the very problems we \u2019 ve been discussing .\nHow did this come to pass ?\nWhat was the catalyst that really drove this pro vaccine agenda worldwide and the push for mandates ?\n\u201c It was in large part the 1986 act signed into law by Ronald Reagan which gave liability protection to the vaccine makers for damage done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a limited liability .\nIt since has become liability for all damage done by all vaccines .\n\u2026 \u201c What it did was give the pharmaceutical industry the perfect business model of a mandatory market and no liability and that was a profit machine .\nThat profit machine allowed them to buy the politicians , the media , to buy public opinion , and to buy the medical profession .\nThat has made them extremely powerful .\n\u201c What circumvents the 1986 Act is fraud .\nIf they can be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put people in harm \u2019 s way , if they knew they could make vaccines safer and they chose not to and hid that fact , then they \u2019 re liable .\nOne way of bringing this act to its knees and forcing revision or repeal is to expose that fraud .\n\u201c In my opinion , what the film reveals is premeditated , first degree murder .\n\u2026 1:01:50 Dr. Mikovits : \u201c You can find us promoting Plague of Corruption , which is what COVID 19 is and what the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subtitle is called Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science .\nThere is promise in science , and if we can show that many , many , many good doctors , good scientists , and it \u2019 s only the old boys \u2019 corrupt network that has perpetrated this COVID 19 , the largest fraud that is small amount that need to go .\n\u201c We can reorganize , shut down , start over again with true public health agencies to protect public health .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll be at Autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Mikovits also talked about what she had gone through being a whistleblower .\n\u201c \u2026How bad our scientific community is , not only with censorship , but with propaganda masquerading as science as they misinterpret data in order to cover up from this \u2018 plague of corruption.\n\u2019 \u2026 \u201c Never again will something like William Thompson and the data burning party happen .\nWe \u2019 ve got all the data , and the Attorney General has had it on a hard drive since 2015 .\nSo we know the FBI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know exactly what happened They \u2019 re part and parcel to COVID 19 and this plague of corruption .\n\u2026 \u201d 1:12:15 Del Bigtree : \u201c First of all , you can always find me at the Highwire.com of course .\nI \u2019 m doing a weekly talk show , my third year now .\nI \u2019 ve done over 160 episodes of The Highwire with Del Bigtree\u2026 \u201c Of course my nonprofit website is ICanDecide.org , if you want to read about the lawsuits .\n\u2026I really believe that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really need to look at this a different way .\n\u2026Fear is what they \u2019 re trying to sell us .\n\u2026 Know that we are powerful .\nOur bodies are beating this , whether it \u2019 s a manmade virus or it \u2019 s a virus out of Wuhan , it doesn \u2019 t matter .\nWe are amazingly designed\u2026 .\n\u201c The Highwire has grown 25 times , our viewership has increased in eight weeks .\nWe \u2019 ve gone from hundreds of thousands of views to millions of views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our show .\n\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s one person handing it and sharing it to the next person .\n\u2026 \u201c We all have to do our part .\nIt \u2019 s time to come together and take back the world .\n\u2026 \u201d 1:19:20 Kennedy : \u201c I want to share my gratitude \u2026this is such an extraordinary group .\nI \u2019 m so glad I got to sit here with you guys because these people are my friends\u2026 \u201c Children \u2019 s Health Defense now is focusing on information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handing it to our followers in a form that they can use to change the pharmaceutical paradigm .\n\u201c The pharmaceutical companies have subverted our democracy .\nThey are victimizing our children They have captured the agencies that are supposed to protect American citizens from powerful industries .\nThey have corrupted the political process .\nThey have subverted the press .\n\u201c They are using this pandemic , some people call it a \u2018 plandemic \u2019 because it feels so much like there was a plan behind it , to tighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a surveillance state where people , because they \u2019 re scared of a virus , will accept these intrusions on their liberties , on their civil rights .\n\u2026 \u201c They \u2019 re turning us into production units and consuming entities .\nThey can monitor us anytime .\n\u2026 \u201c 5G is not about bringing you quicker downloads for your video games or for your movies .\nIt \u2019 s about surveillance and control .\nIt \u2019 s about taking all the data from your devices \u2026so they know what you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying , everything about you .\nThat data is the new oil rush of the 21st century .\n\u2026 \u201c Gates has a chip that will turn on and off a woman \u2019 s menstrual process so she can and can not have babies .\n\u2026Every part of our lives is now going to be subject to control .\n\u201c This disease [ COVID ] is about engineering compliance .\nIt \u2019 s about training us to do what we \u2019 re told , to not go to the beach unless we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend unless we \u2019 re given permission .\n\u201c The other day in Malibu police were out on the beach giving thousand dollar tickets to surfers for using the ocean , and people are putting up with this .\nAnd when they get this 5G system in place you won \u2019 t even see that because they \u2019 ll know when you are at the beach by looking at your cell phone , by

interesting article with an interview , How Bacteria Could Affect Outcomes Of COVID-19 Patients \u201c As the COVID-19 pandemic continues , scientists are racing to unravel every aspect of how this novel virus behaves .\nThe elderly , those with pre-existing conditions and members of disadvantaged communities with less access to health care have the worst outcomes .\nBut what scientists do n't understand is why some people who fall outside those groups are also being hospitalized \u2014 in some cases dying \u2014 while others are not\u2026.Among those trying to figure that out is Dr. Ronald Collman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Pennsylvania , who thinks that our microbiome \u2014 the bacteria and fungi that live in our bodies and on our skin \u2014 may be playing a role .\nInfluenza and other respiratory viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial super-infections , which are frequently associated with a more severe clinical course .\n...\nThis raises the possibility that disruptions in the normal microbial communities by an acute viral infection might contribute to the development of post-viral bacterial pneumonia\u2026.Interactions between respiratory tract infections and the gut microbiome are bidirectional .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut microbiome , the gut microbiome also shapes the adaptive immune responses against respiratory pathogens .\nWe are not hearing about this enough , so I need to share this information , that more than half of Covid-19 patients have gastrointestinal issues as they are becoming infected with the virus .\nSome important facts on that topic : We are in , \u201c The Age of Covid-19 \u201d right now .\nAll of us .\nWe keep hearing about \u201c the new normal \u201d and how we will manage in this \u201c new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had ill children and young adults with immune issues , some of this is a world that we have already inhabited .\nIt has always included washing your hands excessively , keeping your distance from sick people , avoiding crowds , not touching doorknobs , etc .\nI have been a follower of microbiome research and autism , as it has been pivotal for my daughter having better days of health and life .\nThe devastation that we are seeing with a novel virus hitting the populations around the globe has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little bacteria or fungi in the lungs , the nature of those microbes changes when people develop a disease , he says .\nThe range of microbes present throughout our bodies determines how the immune system responds\u2026\u2026 .\nAnother recent study , not yet peer reviewed , also was done , Gut microbiota may underlie the predisposition of healthy individuals to COVID-19 , showing the growing importance of this research .\nWe have heard in the news about symptoms of this virus .\nA brand new study , Neurological complications of coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not always confined to the respiratory tract , and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies .\n.\nNeurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19 , such as headache , dizziness , myalgia and anosmia , as well as cases of encephalopathy , encephalitis , necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy , stroke , epileptic seizures , rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome , associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection .\nThere seems to be evidence that again , having a good microbiome can protect against some of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage from viral infections How might this damage be happening ?\nWhile COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 , is generally a respiratory infection with coughing and shortness of breath as key features of the illness , some people have reported other symptoms , including loss of smell , heart trouble , and diarrhea ... Scientists say that these non-lung symptoms might also be good indicators of SARS-CoV-2 .\nOnce inside a person \u2019 s body , the novel coronavirus attaches to a protein on human cells called angiotensin-converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme , which is normally involved in blood pressure regulation , sits on the surface of different types of cells , including those in the brain , blood vessels , heart , intestines , and kidneys\u2026 .\nIn children , we are hearing about increasing cases of Kawasaki Disease associated with Covid 19 .\nVery scary .\nInterestingly , Kawasaki Disease has a long line of research connecting it to a very imbalanced microbiome .\nThere have been cases of Covid-19 presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms .\nAs a result , researchers have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) and an increased risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as encephalopathy , psychosis , depression and mood changes .\nFrom their study , Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 ?\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms : Viral shedding in feces of COVID-19 patients is known to occur for at least five weeks post-infection ( Yongjian Wu et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nAlthough the extent and mechanisms of viral infiltration of gut epithelium by SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown , ACE2 is expressed by gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 patients present with gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms ( Zhang et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nAs such , gastroenterologists performing fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) to treat C. difficile have identified the need to screen donors for potential GI infiltration by SARS-CoV-2 ( Ianiro et al.\n, 2020 ) .\nIt may be the case that SARS-CoV-2 infection precipitates changes in gut microbial composition , which could be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms via the gut-brain axis ; this remains largely speculative , but is mechanistically feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Studies of past respiratory viral pandemics suggest that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms can arise in the context of acute viral infection , or after variable periods of time post-infection .\nReports from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that influenza pandemics in particular have been marked by increased incidences of various neuropsychiatric symptoms , such as insomnia , anxiety , depression , mania , psychosis , suicidality , and delirium ( Honigsbaum , 2013 , Menninger , 1926 ) .\nFor instance , encephalitis lethargica ( EL ) is an inflammatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychosis , catatonia , and Parkinsonism , the incidence of which increased around the time of the \u201c Spanish \u201d influenza pandemic of the early 20th century ( Von Economo , 1932 Future Treatments for the Microbiome in Covid-19 ?\nNOTE : These are for discussion purposes only and please consult a doctor if you have any questions about your health .\nThere are not many treatments yet for Covid-19 .\nPrevention , besides washing your hands and social distancing , is not yet established , though the search for a vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential COVID-19 vaccines are under study , and six of those are already being tested on humans in phase I clinical trials to determine if they \u2019 re safe\u2026.Anthony Fauci , MD , a member of the White House coronavirus task force and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has often cited a possible 12- to 18-month timeline .\nAnd that is probably extremely optimistic , says Paul Offit , MD , director of the Vaccine Education Center and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see how 12 to 18 months is possible , '' he says .\n`` That is ridiculously fast .

down breastfeeding .\nPolice were mingling with people in the crowd .\nIt was a peaceful 4 th of July party .\nOne of the things that the Freedom Angels wanted to emphasize was that this was supposed to be a peaceful rally ; for most of the day , everything was peaceful .\nAccording to Tara Thorton : One of the larger demonstrations took place in Sacramento , California on the Capitol grounds .\nAbout 5,000 people attended .\nSome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mu\u00f1oz Gleisner , Tara Thornton , and Denise Aguilar , also known as the Freedom Angels .\nThis is a non-profit group that actively advocates to protect human rights and constitutional freedoms such as informed consent and protecting the body sovereignty of all Americans .\nThe Freedom Angels said that the California Highway Patrol and the Sacramento Police were informed that the protest was going to be held that day , and they stayed in regular contact with them up to the day of the event and throughout the day .\nMay 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to reopen America , but the date was extended again and hence , as an expression of growing frustrations , demonstrations were organized by different groups in each state .\nWhile most people understood the challenges that COVID 19 represented , there were a wide range of different concerns over how the governors in each state were handling the crisis .\nSome groups wanted businesses reopened while others were most concerned with government infringement on constitutional and basic human rights .\nThere were also those who raised questions about the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy people needed to wear face masks .\nStill others just wanted to go back to work , exercise in a gym , go to a restaurant and in general , for life to return back to normal .\nOn May 1 , 2020 , citizens demonstrated across America over the measures that different states were taking to deal with the COVID 19 situation .\nDemonstrations were taking place from California to New York , as well as multiple demonstrations within each state .\nSome were large , consisting of thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few hundred people .\nMost were peaceful , but at least one turned violent as was the case the Freedom Angels found themselves caught in during their Sacramento , California demonstration .\nTara explained that this was the atmosphere for hours .\nWithout warning , however , things took a turn for the worse .\nHours into the protest , an order was given to get the protesters to get off the Capitol grounds .\nBased on their conversations with police officials , this order came from \u201c the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning that it came from Governor Newsom himself .\n\u201c It was just simply a political move he made .\nNo one was violent , \u201d according to Heidi of the Freedom Angels .\nWhat the demonstrators did not know was that in addition to the police officers who were outside mingling with the people , there were about 700 officers inside the Capitol Building .\nAll of a sudden , officers started pouring out of the building .\nBarriers had been set up before the demonstration on both sides of the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the street .\nThe Angels all believe that the barriers installed in advance for a peaceful demonstration meant that they were planning to \u201c ambush \u201d the demonstrators from the very beginning !\n\u201c As soon as the officers came out of the building , they were very aggressive .\nThey were trying to maneuver people to the street .\nThey had their batons out and began pressing up against the crowd .\nThey caught everyone by surprise .\nIt was like they wanted us to become violent , \u201d explains Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people in the crowd could not even hear the order to move back .\nThis was because the police did not have a sound system or even a blow horn .\nAs the police advanced , the Freedom Angels , who were in the front , got caught in the middle of the advancing police and the crowd , who were largely motionless because they did not know what was going on .\nFurthermore , Denise notes that the police did not even give people a few minutes to gather their things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children were also caught in the midst of the confusion .\nThe fact that most people could not hear the order to move back made matters much worse .\n\u201c There was nowhere to go , \u201d Heidi Mu\u00f1oz Gleisner explained .\n\u201c I suddenly found my feet pinned underneath a handicap scooter and I was terrified that my feet were about to be broken because they were pushing me so hard against the scooter.\n\u201d The Angels also said that an officer reached over to the scooter handle to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded , Heidi \u2019 s feet would have been broken and many in the crowd , who were pressed up against the scooter , including Tara , would have been hurt .\nFortunately , Heidi saw a friend in the crowd reach over and pull the key out , preventing the scooter from starting , and thereby averting an even greater tragedy !\nHeidi also explained how the all-male police officers lifted her up in the air , spreading her legs in front of the crowd of officers and protestors , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading with them not to do that and to put her legs down because she was wearing a dress .\n\u201c They were deliberately trying to shame me in the worst possible way , \u201d said Heidi .\nTara \u2019 s treatment by the all-male police officers was also traumatic .\nShe said that she felt the end of a baton thrust into her back , which was very painful .\nTara also pointed out that what this officer did with his baton was a violation because a person \u2019 s spine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the baton , she said , was for an officer to hold a baton at both ends and only use the width of the baton to push people .\nWhat this officer did with his baton , according to Tara , could have caused her serious or even permanent injury .\nShe yelled out that they were hurting her and that this was not necessary .\nTara kept asking the officers to stop attacking the people because they were all peaceful .\nSome of her pleas were captured on video .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an officer grabbed one of her arms from behind and started twisting it against her back , which was so painful that she started screaming .\nThe pain she was in was evident on her face in the numerous photographs of this moment .\nShe said that she continued to plead with the male officer to stop , but instead of stopping , the same officer grabbed her other arm from behind and started applying even more pressure .\nThe officer then tied her hands very tightly behind her back with plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers grabbed her legs and lifted her up in the air and spread her legs open , despite the fact that she was wearing a dress .\nAs disturbing as all this was , Denise never imagined that there was a possibility that she might be arrested , because if she had , she said , \u201c I would have worn different undergarments.\n\u201d The end result was that when the police lifted Denise up in the air and spread her legs , \u201c The crowd could see everything , \u201d said Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicts the excessive force inflicted on the Freedom Angels and other protesters .\nBoth Tara and Denise sustained bodily injuries from the police batons .\nHeidi incurred a bruise on her head , while Tara got one on her arm .\nInside the Capitol Building , Heidi was handcuffed from behind with zip-ties and then thrown to the floor face down .\nHeidi said : \u201c My face could have been disfigured and my skull could have been cracked !\nThey did not seem to care !\n\u201d Later , the Freedom Angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen other protestors were handcuffed with zip-ties .\nThe women explained that it was a completely different vibe once they got to the basement where they were met with a different group of officers .\n\u201c They were all nice .\nWe told them they shouldn \u2019 t be doing this .\nWe told them that they had broken their oath , \u201d Tara stated .\nThe women also felt that some of the officers were ashamed to see how the situation was being handled and could not believe they were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still uncomfortably cuffed in the basement , the women described how they saw the next wave of police officers go out into the crowd in full riot gear .\nThey were like storm troopers , pushing the line of protestors back about 35-40 feet to the street .\nThey were just pushing and starting to pull people .\nAn elderly man who was also in the basement with us said that if they given five minutes to clear the area , he would not have been arrested .\nA fifteen-year old girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested .\nA total of 32 people were arrested .\nThe charges against the Freedom Angels were vague but essentially claimed that they were violating the new health safety guidelines .\nThe ironic thing was that the police officers making the arrests were not wearing masks or gloves , and numerous photographs and videos show that police were not practicing social distancing as officers stood shoulder-to-shoulder when they formed the skirmish line and started to physically push the crowd off the premises .\nThe Freedom Angels believe that the reason why such violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials wanted to send a message to the public that if people try to stand up for their rights , this is what is going to happen to them .\nBut this experience has had the exact opposite effect on the Freedom Angels .\nTara , Heidi and Denise all stated that they feel even more determined than before .\n\u201c It has strengthened our resolve , \u201d said Tara .\nThe Freedom Angels strongly believe that the most important thing people should know about what happened that day was the positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very diverse mixture amongst the demonstrators .\nThere were many people of different races , ethnicities , social economic status , political affiliations and so forth .\nWe were all there united in a common cause like one big family and it was beautiful !\nNot only was the crowd peaceful throughout the day , everyone remained peaceful even when the police launched their assault !\nThat is the most important thing that people need to understand .\nEven though the Governor and the police wanted us to become violent , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized the importance of peaceful protest , they also believe that many more people need to get involved because the issues are so serious .\nTara pointed out that : \u201c Every minute that goes by , there are more people suffering from the lockdown and the consequences of it.\n\u201d They feel that people need to stay on top of their governors and other officials and express their concerns .\nThe Angels feel that people should remain positive and courageous despite the odds .\nAs Tara put it : We are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there .\nThere is nothing special about us .\nAnyone can do what we are doing .\nAnyone can stand strong in the face of tyranny .\nWe are no different .\nWe can do this together .\nWe can stand shoulder-to-shoulder in peaceful , nonviolent resistance .\nWe can fight this tyranny .\nWe can fight for another way forward .\nYou can follow the Freedom Angels on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , YouTube , and Telegram .\nIt is up to each individual to weigh the merits of the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw their own conclusions .\nDanielle Gale is a health freedom activist .\nCurtis Cost is an

ways that a product can go wrong , often quite frequently and admitted by the manufacturer ( if not always disclosed by those administering ) .\nFor instance , I have recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according

"Healthy People Wearing Masks, Should They or Shouldn\u2019t They?", "content": "However , several studies show most people infected have mild to no symptoms and fully recover .\nA few recent studies looking at populations with real data of people who were infected , that did not have symptoms or receive treatment , have shown the death rate to be much lower than previously reported .\nIt looks like the death rate from this is higher because not everybody has been exposed , so the death rate is higher in those known to be exposed .\nThe problem is we don \u2019 t know how many have been exposed .\nWithout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t really know the risk of dying if you become infected .\nLooking at risk of death from this novel coronavirus , we need to look at real numbers .\nThe models and predictions have not been shown to be accurate .\nThe population in the United States is approximately 326,700,000 .\nAs of May 9 , 76,934 have been reported to die from COVID , as a complication of it , or with it .\nUsing the real numbers of people potentially at risk ( as we all are ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be 0.00023 or 0.023 % of the population .\nThat is essentially a 0 % death rate in the general population .\nIn the process of making decisions one must evaluate the options , including the risks and benefits of the recommendation .\nWhile there is considerable debate about this subject , because of the current coronavirus situation , healthy people are being told by government officials to wear masks .\nTo evaluate this recommendation , we have to ask some commonsense questions : The following is a version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators .\nHealthy people wearing masks .\nThese days you see them everywhere .\nBut according to Patricia Neuenschwander , M.S.N.\n, R.N.\n, C.P.N.P.-P.C.\n, an emergency room nurse with over two decades of experience , the science doesn \u2019 t support healthy people wearing masks .\nWhen Neuenschwander found out that her grandchild \u2019 s Montessori preschool was going to require even toddlers to wear masks , she did a deep dive into the research to better educate herself and her grandchild \u2019 s school about mask-wearing .\nNote : Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excerpt of a letter posted on her website by Patricia Neuenschwander to her grandchild 's preschool , after the school suggested that the young students must wear masks .\nAbout Patricia Neuenschwander : Patricia Neuenschwander , MSN , RN , CPNP-PC , is a board-certified pediatric nurse practitioner .\nA registered nurse for over 25 years , she is the co-founder , co-owner , and CEO of Creating Brighter Futures , an ABA center , located in Ann Arbor , Michigan .\nShe also currently serves as the office manager for Bio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical practice , which she joined in 2007 .\nShe worked as an emergency department nurse for over 17 years .\nShe left emergency nursing to return to school to pursue a Master \u2019 s of Science in Nursing graduating Summa Cum Laude , from Wayne State University in 2014 from the pediatric nurse practitioner program in primary care .\nTricia is a member of the State and National Association of Pediatric Nurses Practitioners .\nShe is a member of Michigan For Vaccine Choice and the Children \u2019 s Health Defense organization .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the health of all children .\nOn a personal note , Tricia is married with 3 children and 3 step-children , as well as 4 grandchildren , one dog , and one cat .\nShe enjoys boating , yoga , and researching vaccine safety .\nHealthy People Wearing Masks , Should They or Shouldn \u2019 t They ?\nBecause most of the people tested were sick or were at a very high risk of infection based on exposure , we have no idea how many fully recovered .\nWe do know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying medical conditions ( like heart or lung disease or diabetes ) seem to be at higher risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19 illness .\nAs none of these risk factors are applicable to healthy children , children with no underlying health issues remain at an extremely low risk of being seriously affected or dying from this infection .\nI have no qualms with people at high risk staying home or wearing a mask in public to try to protect themselves from contracting this infection .\nI do have qualms about healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partake in an intervention that has not shown to benefit anyone ( using science and data ) and can potentially cause harm .\nAn important study using science to evaluate cloth mask use to prevent infection was conducted in March 2011 .\nIt is a large , prospective , randomized clinical trial ; and the first randomized clinical trial ever conducted of cloth masks .\nThe international team of researchers concluded : This study is the first RCT of cloth masks , and the results caution against the use of cloth masks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupational health and safety .\nMoisture retention , reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection .\nFurther research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally .\nHowever , as a precautionary measure , cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs , particularly in high-risk situations , and guidelines need to be updated.\n\u201d This study doesn \u2019 t provide evidence for effectiveness in high-risk populations ; it certainly does not support healthy people wearing cloth masks .\nMore recently , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Public Health reviewed the scientific literature .\nWhile not an exhaustive review of masks and respirators as source control and personal protection equipment ( PPE ) , this review was made in an effort to locate and review the most relevant studies of laboratory and real-world performance to inform our recommendations .\nThe review , which has 52 citations , concludes : We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because : \u2022 There is no scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission \u2022 Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection \u2022 We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers .\nA 2020 study in Seoul , South Korea looked at the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in blocking COVID-19 in a controlled comparison of four patients .\nThe COVID-infected patients were put in negative pressure isolated rooms .\nThe scientists compared disposable surgical masks ( 3 layers ) with reusable cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 times while wearing no mask , surgical mask , or cotton mask .\nInterestingly , all swabs from the outer masks\u2014including surgical masks\u2014were positive for COVID-19 .\nInner masks were also found to be contaminated .\nThat means the mask did not effectively filter out the COVID virus since it is too small .\nThe authors assert : Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered { COVID-19 } during coughs by infected patients.\n\u201d Conclusion : \u201c both surgical and cotton masks seem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination of SARS\u2013CoV-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the environment and external mask surface.\n\u201d The World Health Organization does not support healthy people wearing masks The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has as its mission to direct international health within the United Nations \u2019 system and to lead partners in global health responses .\nSo what does the WHO recommend when it comes to healthy people wearing masks ?\n\u201c WHO stands by recommendation to not wear masks if you are not sick or not caring for someone who is sick.\n\u201d \u201c There is no specific evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mass population has any potential benefit , \u201d Dr. Mike Ryan , an epidemiologist who specializes in infectious diseases and public health and who is the executive director of the WHO health emergencies program , said at a media briefing .\n\u201c In fact , there \u2019 s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly \u201d ( source ) .\nAccording to the CDC , avoiding close contact with sick individuals ; frequently washing your hands with soap and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or mouth with unwashed hands are effective prevention tips .\nThe CDC also recommends covering your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others , and practicing good respiratory hygiene ( source ) .\nBut here \u2019 s the rub .\nThe CDC then goes on to say that the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected but there are no scientific citations to support that wearing a mask is effective at preventing you from spreading the virus to others .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons America \u2019 s surgeon general , Jerome Adams , M.D.\n, M.P.H.\n, said in an interview in March that masks can be dangerous is because people tend to touch their masks many times per hour and can spread the disease that way .\nA CNN News story that has since been removed from the internet had a headline that read : \u201c Masks may actually increase your coronavirus risk if worn improperly , surgeon general warns \u201d ( click here to read it via the Wayback Machine ) : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wearing a mask if you are not a health care provider , \u201d Adams said during an interview on Fox & Friends on Monday morning .\n\u201c Folks who don \u2019 t know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus , \u201d Adams said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re certainly seeing more spread in communities , but it \u2019 s important for folks to know that right now their risk as American citizens remains low .\nThere are things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are things they shouldn \u2019 t be doing and one of the things they shouldn \u2019 t be doing in the general public is going out and buying masks , \u201d he said .\nOn a separate page , the CDC discusses masks .\nThey write : CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain ( e.g.\n, grocery stores and pharmacies ) , especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\n\u201d However , there are no scientific citations provided to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say that the recommendation has changed because they have figured out it is transmissible person to person .\nThese mixed messages are confusing .\nBut what we know for sure is that the CDC knew from February 26 when the first community spread case documented in the U.S. that this virus was transmitted person to person ; and not only was there no recommendation to wear a mask then , they strongly opposed the general public wearing masks .\nAdditionally , The World Health Organization warned of human to human transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus ( in the 41 confirmed cases ) , mainly through family members , and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak .\nThe lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS , MERS and other respiratory pathogens \u201d ( source ) .\nThe CDC has known for decades that the influenza virus is transmitted person to person , but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the spread of that virus .\nAs a matter of fact , the CDC specifically says masks don \u2019 t work ; and they do not recommend wearing a mask , to prevent transmission of the flu !\nNo recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons , including those at high risk for complications , to prevent exposure to influenza viruses \u201d ( source ) .\nBut wait .\nOn this separate page related to the recommendation to wear a face covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications to support the use of masks for COVID \u2013 https :

Baltimore and others put out the same piece giving the public no details on how the findings were reached .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing is just projection .\nThe CDC looked at the statistics for

one of my favorites !\n\u201d I shared , \u201c I love that he \u2019 s here every time we are.\n\u201d We got in the car and started on our trip back home .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and how we can keep up with what the doctor suggested we do .\nWe talked about seeing other kids in the clinic knowing they had many more challenges than she did .\nWe also talked about the moms and dads and how hard some of this might be for them , especially with some restrictions and rules still in place .\nShe thoughtfully considered everything she \u2019 d seen and then took a short nap .\nBefore we got back into town , I decided that I wanted to run some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already long day , but I wanted to see if I could replenish some of items I couldn \u2019 t find at our local shops .\nPulling into a parking spot at a small grocery store , I pointed to several people in the store and parking lot .\n\u201c Look , they \u2019 re not wearing masks , \u201d I said .\n\u201c So , we \u2019 re not either ?\n\u201d my youngest asked .\nI told her , \u201c Yep , not that it \u2019 s up them anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nOther places will make you wear a mask , but this place lets you choose.\n\u201d Folding the kid-size one she \u2019 d received at the hospital and putting it back down next to her , she said , \u201c I \u2019 m not wearing one either.\n\u201d I told her she could if she wanted to , I would never stop her from doing that , but she agreed .\nWe \u2019 re not sick .\nWe \u2019 re not a threat , so her mask , like mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it perfect timing as one of my very favorite songs came on the radio as we unbuckled our seatbelts .\nExcitedly , I heard from the backseat , \u201c MOM , we are *not* getting out of the car yet .\nWe need to turn this up and listen to the whole thing first.\n\u201d Agreeing with my little mini-me , we sat in the parking lot and rocked out .\nSinging along , I looked at my child as she sang those lyrics and could only think , from your lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dear .\nSomeday , we will be victorious .\nThey will not force us They will stop degrading us They will not control us We will be victorious !\nCathy

.\nTrying to cover up what happened ?\nDouble check .\nI suggest that we all pay very close attention to one commonality between the Dengue vaccine tragedyand our previous experiences with trying to create a vaccine for Coronaviruses .\nThe adverse reactions to the Dengue vaccine were caused by an immune system over-reaction called `` disease enhancement '' 4which would occur when a vaccinated child later became exposed to the Dengue virus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hyper-reaction has also been seen consistently with other similar vaccines such as RSV and ... yes ... earlier types of Coronaviruses .\nWe also see this same type of reaction , caused by what \u2019 s called a \u201c cytokine storm \u201d within the immune system , in patients seriously ill with COVID-19 , so there is good reason to believe that a vaccine for this new Coronavirus could cause these same adverse reactions .\nAnd so here we are , with our president proclaiming that `` Operation Warp Speed '' will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unprecedented haste .\nThere is political pressure to fast-track this new vaccine like a vaccine has never been fast-tracked before .\nThere are many different candidate vaccines at various stages of

Autism Despite ongoing increases in the number of children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) nationwide , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has consistently failed to declare ASD an epidemic .\nThis public messaging decision highlights the CDC \u2019 s ongoing disregard for prevalence increases over time that support the overriding importance of environmental causes rather than genetics causality in this serious childhood health condition .\nAccording to the most recent 2018 survey from the National Survey of Children \u2019 s Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American children ages 3-17 have an Autism spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) , over 1.7 million children ( see HERE ) .\nUsing a different method , the recently released CDC report from its Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ( ADDM ) Network , reported an average ASD rate of 185 per 10,000 among 8-year-old children born in 2008 , or 1 in 54 .\n( see , HERE ) .\nThe CDC proudly promotes ADDM as the only collaborative network to track the number and characteristics of children with ASD .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the 2014 ADDM Network report , which reported a rate of 1 in 59 .\n( see HERE ) .\nComparing recent ADDM Network ASD rates to those first reported by the network in 2000 , there is a staggering 176 % increase when compared the earliest ASD report rate of 1 in 149 among 8-year-old children in 2000 .\n( see HERE ) .\nChanges by year and site are shown in Figure 1 .\nThe only acknowledgment of urgency in the 2014 ADDM report , is a sentence buried deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c an urgent public health concern.\n\u201d In the most recent ADDM 2016 report , an autism rate of 1 in 54 is merely \u201c a continuing public health concern \u201d as shown in Figure 2 .\nInstead of raising the alarm over their unbending upward trend line , the CDC reserves its main concerns for racial equality : applauding the fact that autism in African Americans is now broadly similar to that of white and Asian Americans .\nUsing the ADDM Network methodology , ASD cases are identified through a review and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who systematically review information to determine ASD case status .\nThe CDC claims its methodological approach provides the \u201c best possible estimate currently available of prevalence of ASDs without conducting complete population screening and diagnostic clinical case confirmation.\n\u201d ( see , HERE ) .\nIf the CDC believes ASD rate increases over time are result of racial inequities , why haven \u2019 t they recommended population screening and diagnostic case confirmation in underserved populations to obtain more accurate statistics ?\nThe ADDM Network has no evidence of overall flattening or declining ASD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalies in the data reported from a number of sites , including most notably Utah , and Maryland .\nMaryland \u2019 s ascertainment areas changed with the inclusion of a second site with reduced access to school records .\nIn Utah \u2019 s case , as one of us has pointed out in her 2013 complaint , intentional deviations from the ADDM Network methodological procedures were allowed and covered up by the ADDM Network and University of Utah ( U of U ) .\nThe two of us share a longstanding concern over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm with respect to the sharp and ongoing increases in autism rates .\nOne of us has been critical of CDC \u2019 s fraudulent misuse of statistics for nearly two decades .\nAnother of us , was once a CDC insider and Principal Investigator for the Utah ADDM site , Utah Registry of Autism and Developmental Disabilities .\nAfter beginning to raise concerns over environmental causation , data errors and privacy violations in the Utah autism data one of us ( Zimmerman ) was summarily dismissed from her position .\nShe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her former employer the U of U .\nIn addition , Zimmerman became so concerned about intentional data manipulation and public messaging by ADDM officials , she asked two United States Congressmen , Utah Democrat Ben McAdams and Florida Republican Bill Posey , to support a congressional investigation into research fraud by the ADDM Network and U of U .\n( Read the letter here ) Zimmerman was the original CDC grant awardee and the Utah ADDM principle investigator from 2002-2013 .\nZimmerman believes she now has enough evidence to show serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and intentional deviations from predetermined ADDM study protocols by U of U with the complicity of ADDM Network Officials .", "author": "Age of Autism",

Fewer Children Dying?", "content": "That said , the spike in deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 occurred in tandem with the spike in all-cause deaths , leaving little doubt that Covid19 was the main contributor to the excess of expected deaths between March 22 and May 9 .\nAttributing a Cause of Death ( COD ) to COVID-19 is not always clear-cut , due to significant overlap among COVID-19 , Pneumonia , Influenza , and presumably other primary CODs .\nTens of thousands more Americans than expected died in a brief period .\nBefore mid-March , overall U.S. deaths were trending at a level no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per week .\nBeginning in the week ending on March 28 , all-cause deaths began rising sharply , peaking in the week ending April 11 at around 75,000 , or 137 % of Expected Deaths for the week .\nImmediately thereafter , all-cause deaths began dropping sharply .\nWithin five weeks , all-cause deaths were back to their typical range .\nBy the week ending May 16 , the measurable pandemic death impact had ended even though Covid19-related deaths most certainly had not .\nIn the analysis that follows we have examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( mostly by state ) , by age group and by week ( and flu season ) .\nWe have extracted eight main lessons .\nSome of these are part of the ongoing conversation around Covid19 ; others are unexpected or at least have not been widely circulated .\nWhy this discrepancy ?\nSince the infectious disease establishment has controlled the \u201c pandemic \u201d narrative , the variance between this evidence and conventional wisdom is largely driven by longstanding bias and error patterns among the experts in that community .\nDeath rates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe most pronounced variation occurs by age cohort ( most deaths occur in the elderly ) and by time of year and to a lesser extent by geography .\nAll-cause deaths are cyclical , commonly rising in the winter months and \u201c flu season \u201d and then falling to lower levels as warmer weather arrives .\nTo the extent that death rates vary by region , this is mostly a result of differences in the age mix of residents .\nIn the case of Covid19 , death rates are not yet known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly by age and geography .\nCovid19 is a serious public health issue , but the breathless reporting among the media of positive tests and an ever-rising death toll does little to instruct us about the true nature of the virus and the unprecedented steps taken to prevent its impact .\nAs in many complex and pervasive health phenomena , there are many ways to measure health effects , but in our view the proper measure of impact is not a narrow or intermediate metric , but rather total health outcomes .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large populations and where the immediate concern is sharp increases in deaths , the best measure of outcomes is not a selective measure of deaths somehow attributed to the disease but instead is deaths from all causes .\nFor perspective , these deaths must be compared to historical death rates from all causes in prior years ( Percent of Expected Deaths ) .\nAs we will show , a balanced view of the broader American Covid19 experience demonstrates both the scale and variability of its negative outcomes in older Americans , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSurprisingly , U.S. mortality rates have declined among young people during the lockdown , especially among infants .\nThese trends have gone largely unnoticed and remain unexplained .\nBy Amy Becker and Mark Blaxill ( To review , share and print this White Paper it its original formatting , Download Lessons from the Lockdown HERE . )\nAt least in this 8-week period , the Covid19 pandemic was considerably worse than a typical flu season .\nTo the extent that all-cause deaths fell back to expected levels during May , the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Localization .\nIncreases in all-cause death rates during the pandemic have been extremely localized , varying widely by state/jurisdiction .\nFor the 3 \u00bd month period surrounding the pandemic , starting on February 1 through May 16 ( the most recent period with 100 % reporting ) , total deaths in the US came in at 105 % of expectations .\nMany states actually saw lower than expected deaths during the period .\nTo be sure , an excess death rate of 5 % for the entire U.S. is considerable but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic has received .\nGreater-than-expected death rates were heavily concentrated in the Northeastern corridor .\nNew York City and its surrounding area , including New Jersey , New York State ( although possibly not upstate New York ) , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Maryland and the District of Columbia have so far comprised 6 of top 8 jurisdictions with excess all-cause deaths .\nNew York City was hit especially hard .\nIn a typical spring , New York City could expect 700-800 all-cause deaths per week .\nFrom mid-March to mid-May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that amount , reaching over 7500 deaths in the peak week ending April 11 .\nOther Northeastern states saw sharp increases in expected deaths but nowhere near New York City \u2019 s rate .\nThe timing of the peaks has varied , Massachusetts came soonest , followed by Maryland , New York City New York State and New Jersey .\nNevertheless , the entire region saw declines in expected deaths starting in May .\nMany states saw no or only a modest increase in expected deaths , including some of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas .\nThis suggests there may have been specific factors that influenced the experience in New York City that were not shared elsewhere .\n\u2022 Variation by policy environment .\nTo the extent that policies have varied across the states , it is not clear that the imposition and/or presence of stringent lock-down policies had much to do with the variation in excess deaths .\nLess stringent lockdown policies were not associated with higher death rates .\nIn fact , the 5 states that chose not to impose a lockdown are among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all .\nSeveral states with the most aggressive lockdowns , including California , Maine , Minnesota and Pennsylvania showed almost no excess deaths effect .\nDespite huge population centers , California looked nothing like New York City and State .\nMaine , a mostly rural state , imposed among the more draconian policies with essentially no reason .\nMinnesota followed a far more aggressive lockdown policy than its neighboring states of Iowa , South Dakota , North Dakota and Wisconsin .\nYet it \u2019 s Covid19 deaths were among the most concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minnesota \u2019 s Covid19 deaths occurred among the infirm elderly who were residents of long-term care facilities .\nDid aggressive lockdowns stave off the worst-case scenario , preventing vulnerable states from becoming disaster areas like New York City ?\nNo controlled experiment will give us that answer .\nPennsylvania makes the best case for that argument , with an early excess death pattern that resembled its neighbors in the Northeaster corridor but saw that rate drop precipitously by early April.\u2014 .\nBut Pennsylvania is also an unusual geographic unit , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast and separated from the western part of the state and its second largest city , Pittsburgh , by the Appalachian Mountains .\nThis anomaly makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions from Pennsylvania \u2019 s Covid19 curve .\n\u2022 Age effect : elderly .\nOne universally accepted fact of the Covid19 pandemic is that the death risk is highest among the elderly .\nThe all-cause death numbers show this effect clearly , with a stark increase in deaths among those 65 years and older beginning in late March , peaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , so that by month end the excess death rate has almost disappeared .\nTens of thousands of excess deaths in this age group have driven a large portion of overall US excess deaths .\nAdults between 18-64 years of age show a similar pattern in excess deaths as the elderly , although the overall death toll has been less .\nWith a dataset that provides more detailed age groupings , the impact is even more clear : the older the age cohort , the more total deaths increased during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as increases in deaths occur in those aged 85 years old and older , followed by those aged 75-84 , next by the age group from 65-74 .\nThe sole remaining group showing an increase in deaths during the pandemic was the group aged 55-64 , with a modest increase in deaths during April .\nFor all age cohorts with ages under 55 , the impact of the pandemic is undetectable .\nMost observers believe they understand this age effect and discount it .\nThat older people die more frequently is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .\nBut as we have deployed lockdowns as a blunt instrument to protect the elderly from a tragic and premature loss of life-years , we have missed a completely unintended and beneficial benefit of the lockdowns : an unexplained collapse in excess deaths among the young , especially children and infants .\n\u2022 Age effect : children .\nDeaths among children under 18 years of age are relatively rare and show patterns that are different from their seniors .\nThe pronounced cyclical effect in all-cause deaths one sees among adults is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly deaths among adults dominate the overall US death toll\u2014around 13,000 deaths per week in 18-64-year-olds and 35-40,000 deaths per week among those 65 and older\u2014weekly deaths among children are scattered across the states and typically fall around 700 .\nWell over half of that occurs in infants under 1 year of age .\nBut the pandemic experience has brought on a surprising effect on this expected death rate among children .\nStarting in early March , expected deaths began a sharp decline , from an expected level of around 700 deaths per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throughout May .\nAs untimely deaths spiked among the elderly in Manhattan nursing homes and in similar settings all over the country , something mysterious was saving the lives of children .\nAs springtime in America came along with massive disruptions in family life amid near universal lockdowns , roughly 30 % fewer children died .\nWas this a protective effect of school closures ?\nWere teenagers getting themselves into risky situations at a lower rate ?\nNo .\nThere was very little effect among school age children or adolescents .\nVirtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , the changing pattern of American life during the lockdowns has been saving the lives of hundreds of infants , over 200 per week .\nDeaths in infants and children occur at a higher rate in minority groups .\nSo , the reduction in childhood deaths during the lockdowns has meant that the lives of black and Hispanic infants and children have been saved at a higher rate .\n\u2022 Net effect in life-years .\nEvery untimely death is tragic .\nBut if one considers life-years lost , the premature death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature death of someone whose life expectancy is 5 years or less .\nAnd whereas the median age at death of , say , a Minnesotan dying of Covid19 is 83 , the typical life expectancy of that senior citizen absent Covid19 might be just 2-3 more years .\nBy comparison , when an infant in lockdown avoids a death , the potential impact in life years saved can rise to 80 years or more .\nWhen one measures the net effect of life years either lost or gained during the pandemic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age groups is unexpectedly mixed .\n( 5 ) Not surprisingly , excess deaths are highest in the oldest seniors where life expectancy is the lowest .\nCombining the excess deaths with life expectancy by age group ( with an adjustment for the quality of those life-years ) shows the toll of the pandemic : about 540,000 life-years lost among those 65 and older .\n( 3 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) By comparison , the reduction in expected deaths is highest in infants , where the life expectancy benefits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of over 200 infants per week were saved during the month of May .\nCombining the number of lives saved in infants and children aged 1-4 , demonstrates a smaller but comparably large and beneficial effect : roughly 145,000 life-years saved among children under 5 .\nNoting the surprising effect of the lockdown on infants and children under 5 does nothing to negate the tragic effect of the pandemic on the elderly .\nIt does , however , raise a question : why are so many fewer children dying ?\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause is frequently some form of congenital condition or birth defect .\nSadly , accidents and homicides are frequent causes as well .\nThere are however , frequent cases in which previously healthy infants die unexpectedly .\nThese deaths are usually classified as \u201c Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \u201d or SIDS .\nAccording to the CDC , SIDS deaths are one of the two largest causes of death among infants aged 1 month to 1 year .\n( 7 ) We have no specific data on the trend in SIDS deaths during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard anecdotal reports from emergency room ( ER ) doctors suggesting some have observed a decline in SIDS .\nOne doctor who says he might see 3 cases of SIDS in a typical week has seen zero cases since the pandemic and associated lockdowns began .\nWhat has changed during this period that might have such an effect ?\nAre infant deaths not being recorded ?\nAre parents taking better care of their families while working remotely and their children are not going to school ?\nThere are many possible hypotheses about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that has received publicity is that public health officials are bemoaning the sharp decline in infant vaccinations as parents are not taking their infants into pediatric offices for their regular well-baby checks .\nIn the May 15 issue of the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) , a group of authors from the CDC and Kaiser Permanente reported a sharp decline in provider orders for vaccines as well as a decline in pediatric vaccine doses administered .\n( 8 ) These declines began in early march , around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect may not be confined to the U.S .\nThe World Health Organization issued a press release on May 22 noting that , \u201c Since March 2020 , routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization ( EPI ) in the 1970s.\n\u201d ( 9 ) Are fewer children dying because their parents are skipping their routine childhood vaccines ?\nIf lives are being saved during the pandemic , this is a question that urgently needs answering .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mortality toll is measurable , real and convincing .\nIt is also nearly certain to be transitory , but that won \u2019 t stop the propaganda juggernaut from rolling forward .\nHowever , as the saying goes , \u201c the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.\n\u201d What no one would have predicted in advance of Covid19 is that the extreme lockdown response has produced a natural experiment that actually calls into question the very actions\u2014widespread , mandated vaccines for all -- that the infectious disease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nWe should mourn the deaths of the elderly Manhattan nursing home residents but also take heed of the hundreds of avoided infant deaths .\nOnly with that kind of balance will we draw the proper lessons from the pandemic and the lockdowns that have followed in its wake .\n\u2022 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nNational Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System .\n[ Online ] [ Cited : June 6 , 2020 . ]\nhttps :

longer .\nSealants ?\nIt says here that you were thinking about them .\nActually , I was thinking about NOT doing them .\nI smiled while trying to sound confident , \u201c No , thanks .\nWe won \u2019

without any orthodontic gear .\nPlease use the gluten-free toothpaste and let me know how her teeth look now that the braces are off.\n\u201d The hygienist closed the files and said , \u201c Okay , she can come back with me now.\n\u201d Can I ask you something ?\nWhy don \u2019 t you want sealants ?\nI felt like I was backed into a corner .\nI had two choices : I could answer her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while yelling , \u201c Leave us alone , you nosey Nellie !\n\u201d I took a deep breath and sputtered , \u201c I don \u2019 t want to put anything in my kids \u2019 body that I haven \u2019 t had a chance to look up.\n\u201d Satisfied , the hygienist replied , \u201c Okay , we can get you something to read.\n\u201d Oof .\nI meant that I would go home and look up MY side \u2019 s data , not rely on HERS .\nI wanted to hide .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a 10 \u2019 x 10 \u2019 room wouldn \u2019 t make for the best hiding spot .\nA few minutes later another dental hygienist , one who \u2019 s known us for a few years now , came over to me .\nShe handed me a 4-page print out of information on the sealants our dentist uses .\nAs she handed them to me she reminded me , \u201c Remember , you do what YOU want done , Mom.\n\u201d From what little knowledge I have about sealants , I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when face-to-face with a dental professional who was asking me for a specific reason , I clammed up .\nI thanked our friendly hygienist and kicked myself for not having a better answer earlier .\nI should know what I want my provider to do or not do for my children .\nAfter all , I \u2019 m the Mom .\nRight ?\nMother \u2019 s intuition told me no , don \u2019 t do it .\nThese sealants are not all their cracked up to be .\nAnd even though I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uneasy feeling my gut had about this particular procedure , I had hoped that mother \u2019 s intuition should be answer enough .\nWhile a former dentist several years ago convinced me to start putting them on my children \u2019 s teeth because of the sealants \u2019 cavity-preventing features , at the time I never thought to take the next step to ask what was in those sealants .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until last year when our new dentists suggested I get them for my children that I had the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hadn \u2019 t taken time at home yet to really read about them , the response I gave to the new hygienist was that I wanted to research what sealants were made of and to determine what role , if any , they play in my children \u2019 s health .\nI thought that reply would buy me some time to formulate a solid and scientific answer .\nAfter I started reading the handout , and after I used my phone to search for more information , it wasn \u2019 t time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAfter reading , I knew that the next time I was asked , my answer would be a not just no , but no way .\nFrom the American Academy of Pediatrics website : Dental Sealants Sealants are a plastic material applied to the chewing surface of permanent molars that provide a physical barrier to bacterial invasion of pits and fissures .\nSealants are effective because 90 % of caries in school-aged children occur in the pits and fissures of molars , the place a sealant covers .\nWhile the AAP websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m glad I knew to continue to read .\nHad I just gone to their website , which tends to promote a one-size-fits-all agenda while not fully considering nor disclosing how substances can and do negatively impact human development , I might have caved and let professional pressure persuade me .\nHere is the first page of the paperwork about the specific sealants our dentist uses : Note the Classifications column .\nIt includes two codes : Xi and T. Xi denotes that an ingredient is an irritant .\nT means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded natural , my eyebrows were already raised .\nReading that each ingredient was either an irritant or toxic didn \u2019 t help lower my eyebrows or my suspicions .\nIt only confirmed that this optional treatment would add to an extra burden to my kids \u2019 bodies , a burden that none of them needed to bear .\nI scanned the ingredient list again .\nSodium Monofluorophosphate jumped out at me .\nThe \u201c \u2013fluro \u201d in the middle of the second word made me pause , so I looked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it ?\nYep , it was .\nIt \u2019 s a fluoride compound .\nFluoride is a neurotoxin that we make every attempt to avoid .\nIn retrospect , I \u2019 m glad the dental hygienist handed me the papers when she did .\nThe first page of this Safety Data Sheet confirmed the gut feeling I had\u2014that these sealants would do more harm than good for my children .\nNow very curious as to what else the sealant Safety Data Sheet would reveal , I continued to read .\nEven though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Comments Warning toward the bottom of page three sealed the deal\u2014my kids would NOT being getting them anytime soon .\nIt wasn \u2019 t more than 30 minutes later that I was presented again with the fabulous benefits of sealants .\nThis time , the information came from our dentist while he was finishing my younger daughter \u2019 s exam .\nI nodded and smiled as he went into his spiel about those terrible cavities and the miraculous properties of sealants .\nThanking him for his input , and reminding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , I said , \u201c That \u2019 s nice .\nBut we \u2019 re all set for now , thanks.\n\u201d Assuring me that sealants are recommended only up to a certain age , I again thanked him for the information but stood firm in my decision .\nWith what I \u2019 ve had to learn for my 11-year old son who has regressive autism , and because of how he \u2019 s been injured by recommended and optional medical procedures , I \u2019 ve made it a habit of being fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his providers , his therapists and his educators .\nBut for my typical kids , I \u2019 ve let some research slide .\nThat included taking time to educate myself on why I would not opt for a standard operating dental procedure .\nFortunately , this time , my decision was respected .\nI \u2019 m glad that I \u2019 m only faced with making that particular decision two times a year .\nIn six months , when we return for our next dental cleaning , only time will tell if our dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my decision or not .\nThe reason why I booked my kids \u2019 appointments when I did this summer was because I could devote time to my children \u2019 s healthcare needs .\nQuestions that came up during that afternoon \u2019 s appointments are a reminder that I need to devote the same amount of time to be better prepared for all of my children \u2019 s appointments .\nThis includes reading , researching and asking questions and making sure that when I have learned as much as I can that I remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being able to make informed decisions , especially when those decisions are the exact opposite of what best practices state , is important .\nIt \u2019 s important because my children \u2019 s health depends on it .\nCathy Jameson \u2019 s writing has been featured in Pathways to

decorated with sugars , methyl groups , and other additions like nitrosyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regulate how the DNA is used and that decoration is entirely species specific .\nSo if a chicken cell is used to make our vaccines\u2014we have chicken DNA fragments in the final product , but those are decorated like a chicken , our body will recognize them as foreign and eliminate them .\nIf they were to get into a human cell they could not incorporate into the DNA , they just can not .\nThey actually don \u2019 t even get taken out to any extent .\nNext Kennedy asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells and why human cells were ever used in vaccines in the first place .\nDr. Deisher : Currently the MMR vaccines , the chickenpox vaccine , one of the shingles vaccines , \u2026 all Hepatitis A containing vaccines are made in fetal cells , some polio-containing vaccines and some rabies-containing vaccines .\nPeople can go to our website https : //www.soundchoice.org/ and pull down a list of the vaccines .\nInterestingly Sanofi just switched the manufacture of their polio and polio-containing vaccines away from human fetal cells to an animal cell .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ why vaccine makers started using human fetal cells .\nI think it \u2019 s complicated .\nThe animal rights movement was very active at that time .\nFor instance chickenpox could have been manufactured in a guinea pig cell line , but there \u2019 s quite a bit of objection to using animals for research .\nThe animal activists were definitely driving them to go and use the bodies of aborted babies .\nEconomically they thought that it would be cheaper .\nIt \u2019 s not though because the regulatory aspects are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus costs less than 10 cents .\nVialing the virus is the cost .\nThat \u2019 s 10 dollars .\nIt didn \u2019 t end up being more economically for them .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s kind of weird to think that the animal rights activists have more clout with the vaccine companies than do the anti-abortion activists .\nDr. Deisher : They do , and what \u2019 s really alarming is the lack of outcry over human babies , born alive at five to six months old , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have to be beating to be used in the research that \u2019 s being done .\nIf the heart has stopped beating it \u2019 s not useful .\nYou can not use it .\nSo these babies are delivered alive and their hearts cut out without anesthesia .\nI wouldn \u2019 t do that to a mouse .\n\u2026 Kennedy : And they are surgically killed ?\nDr. Deisher : Their hearts are cut out or they cut through their faces to get good brain tissue .\nKennedy : Stanley Plotkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many vaccines he was involved in .\nHe said that they used the entire fetus .\nThe fetus was aborted and that they were cut into parts .\nThey used the tongues , they used the eyes , they used all the parts of the fetus .\nIs that true or do they just use the heart and the brain ?\nDr. Deisher : They use the baby and certain scientists will purchase the heart , another scientist will purchase the brain .\nThey purchase the legs or the eyes .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a catalogue twenty plus years ago .\nI \u2019 ll never forget the prices .\nThirty-two week old baby , that \u2019 s a living baby .\nEarly deliveries survive at 21 weeks now so we \u2019 re talking about viable babies .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s hard not to start talking about this as morally revolting .\nIt is difficult not to talk about the moral implications of this .\n\u2026 Let \u2019 s go back and talk about the science and I \u2019 ll try to get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Deisher about the effects of using human cells in vaccines versus animal cells .\nKennedy : A lot of the animal tissues contain retroviruses that were then showing up in the human blood supply and the human genome , like the XMRV virus which causes leukemia .\nThey didn \u2019 t know it was in mouse brains , and a lot of the monkey viruses like SV40 which was in all the polio vaccines , which is also a very potent carcinogen .\nThey weren \u2019 t able to detect those animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made .\nI think one of the justifications to switching to human was that you were less likely to get retroviruses .\nDr. Deisher : It was a complicated issue .\n\u2026They didn \u2019 t know that there were retroviruses in the animal cell lines at that time .\nThat knowledge came later with better detection techniques .\nWith the information they had at the time they thought they were doing the best thing .\nThey debated it for fifty years before they allowed it .\nWe \u2019 ve learned so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s time to take another look .\nKennedy : When you use animal tissue the animal DNA is recognized as a foreign substance by your body , and you reject it and excrete it .\nWhen they started using fetal tissue , the fetal tissue is not recognized as foreign .\nWhat are the implications of that ?\nDr. Deisher : In a certain number of people it won \u2019 t be recognized as foreign because it \u2019 s primitive and it has fewer methyl groups on it than a normal person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example human fetal DNA enters your body and you are most likely going to mount an immune response to it when it \u2019 s seen because it \u2019 s not self .\nIt \u2019 s fetal DNA .\nIt \u2019 s primitive .\nIn people who have a genetic predisposition to have lower methylation of their DNA , hypo methylated DNA like if they have an MTHFR mutation , they will mount a response likely to the human fetal DNA .\nThe antibodies are going to be for hypo methylated DNA and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a high chance of having a cell self attack because of the antibodies that they make to the primitive fetal DNA .\nIf a person , a child , even an adult has a genetic predisposition so that their own DNA is a more primitive kind of DNA , it has hypo methylated status , then antibodies to the fetal DNA could turn around and attack the person \u2019 s own body .\nKennedy : Hypo means less .\nIt means it has less of a methylation capacity and methylation capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins \u2026 Dr. Deisher : Methylation controls how genes are used .\nIn a fetal state you \u2019 re using lots of your genes , but when you get to an adult state you don \u2019 t want to use all of the genes that you used during development because you \u2019 re not going through development anymore .\nYou \u2019 re a born organism .\nYou \u2019 re going to want to turn on other genes .\nThe fetal genes after birth get more methyl groups put on them so they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use those methyl groups later on is you can get cancer or you could get an autoimmune disease .\nKennedy brought up the susceptibility to vaccine injury of those people who have the MTHFR gene .\nHe added the vaccine industry claim that not enough of the DNA gets into the person being vaccinated to be harmful .\nDr. Deisher : Anyone who says that doesn \u2019 t know anything about immunology or virology or they would never make such a statement .\nI don \u2019 t think most people even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deisher focused on what happens during pregnancy .\nAs the pregnancy goes on the placenta breaks down , and what happens is that fetal DNA fragments from the baby end up in the mother \u2019 s circulation .\nWhen they reach a certain level they trigger an immune receptor .\nIt \u2019 s called Toll-like receptor 9 .\nThat \u2019 s the same receptor that viruses in DNA vaccines trigger .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s actually an auto-immune response .\nYou \u2019 re notifying your body that the placenta\u2014that placenta is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of it .\nThat \u2019 s what causes women to go into labor .\nDeisher : Exactly .\nAntibodies are made and then they see the baby , the placenta and they attack , and that triggers labor .\nThat \u2019 s a massive auto-immune rejection , right ?\nOr immune rejection .\nThat \u2019 s how you get your baby and that \u2019 s a good outcome .\nWhen we inject infants and young children with the amount of fetal DNA in the vaccines , they have levels in their blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger labor .\nYou can \u2019 t tell me that that is not going to cause an immune response .\nAbsolutely it \u2019 s going to cause an immune response .\nAnyone who says different does not know what they \u2019 re talking about or they \u2019 re not telling the truth .\nKennedy : What you \u2019 re saying is you \u2019 re putting enough DNA into that baby at that same level , less levels of foreign DNA cause a woman to mount an autoimmune response against the placenta and excrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs in a vaccinated individual might be causing actual autoimmunity in those children .\nDeisher : It \u2019 s going to elicit an immune response absolutely and the presence of that immune response if the person is genetically susceptible to having under methylated , low methyl DNA , then they \u2019 re in danger that they could have a later autoimmune response .\nIt could be within days , it could be months down the line .\nThere would have to be exposure of that person \u2019 s own DNA .\nIf that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies that are going to recognize it as foreign and attack that person \u2019 s own organs .\nIt could be 20 years later .\nThere \u2019 s no time frame .\nAs long as those antibodies remain in the body , and antibodies will be around for 10 , 20 maybe even up to 30 years , that person , if they have their own DNA exposed , could end up with an autoimmune disease .\nKennedy brought up Dr. Paul Offit \u2019 s claim that the amount of the vaccine ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact the human body .\nActually that vaccine is intended to permanently alter the immune system of that child .\nThat \u2019 s how they advertise it .\nThat \u2019 s how they sell it .\nThere \u2019 s actually a difference\u2026 Autistic kids where they have those particular DNA strands or antibodies , antibody reactions to the DNA can be found in kids with autism and not in other kids .\nDr. Deisher : There are scientific publications that [ say ] that about 35 to 40 percent of children with autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt means they had to have been exposed to human DNA at some point that triggered them to mount a response , whereas typically developing children don \u2019 t have those antibodies .\nKennedy : Actually the timing of when they started putting fetal DNA into the MMR vaccine was also perfectly correlates with the first change points for the escalation and climb of autism rates in American children .\nDr. Deisher : It does .\nAbout 1979 , 1980 .\nNext Kennedy moved on to talk about cancer .\nDr. Deisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been immortalised , but others are just sort of assumed immortal .\nKennedy : Just so people know , by immortal we mean that they \u2019 re tumorigenic .\nThey \u2019 ve been essentially rendered cancerous .\nThey will never die .\nThey continue breeding and living which makes it easier to grow cultures on them .\nDr. Deisher : One has been transformed with Epstein-Barr virus .\nThat \u2019 s immortal .\nIt \u2019 s called the HEK293 in their cell lines , but the lines used in vaccine manufacture are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching the end of their life span .\nSo people are making new fetal lines to replace them .\n\u2026 They used a portion of Epstein-Barr virus to make the HEK293 cell .\nThe HEK293 cell line isn \u2019 t mused to make the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s a line called MRC5 and WI38 that are predominantly used .\nDr. Deisher noted that the fetal cell lines were from babies aborted in the late 1960 \u2019 s and \u2018 70 \u2019 s .\nKennedy : Could these vaccines be causing cancer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of having the primitive , low methylated human DNA fragments we know about from the field of gene therapy .\n\u2026 What scientists did was they started using small fragments of DNA to correct gene mutations .\nThey correct the mutations in stem cells , and then they give the stem cells back to the person with the gene mutation .\nIt turns out that if you give the DNA fragments to the body , we call them invivo , you inject them into a vein , stem cells love to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primitive source like a fetus or a placenta or sperm .\nIf they \u2019 re from an adult , they don \u2019 t get taken up .\nWhat happens is they readily insert into the genome of the stem cells that take them up .\nIf you do mouse experiments 100 percent of the mice will take up those DNA fragments .\nAnytime you have an insertion , that \u2019 s a mutation .\nIt turns out from what the gene therapy field learned , \u2026those primitive DNA fragments like to insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that cell an advantage or a proliferation advantage .\nOur blood cell formation is a phenomenal biology .\nWe have trillions of blood cells in our body .\nEight parent stem cells typically make all of the other stem cells that give rise to all of those working trillions of blood cells .\nSo you mutate a stem cell , it gets an advantage and it tends to take over and so instead of having eight cells making all the blood cells , you \u2019 ll have one , the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations where we have eight blood cells , eight stem cells making all of our blood cells .\nThat \u2019 s called oligoclonal blood formation .\nWe have diseases where you have monoclonal .\nOne cell takes over that aren \u2019 t cancer .\nIt happens in some forms of heart disease .\nIf you have an mutation in that one stem cell , because you have an insertion , you \u2019 re at high risk to have another mutation , and that becomes cancerous , that \u2019 s very dangerous .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four of nine of boys got cancer .\nScientists like Dr. Offit and Plotkin , those kind of people estimated that the risk was one to the minus 13 .\nIt means we would have to treat more children than exist before we would ever see harm .\nThe real data said four of nine .\nThey were way off .\nI wouldn \u2019 t listen to anything they say about safety .\nKennedy : So what you \u2019 re saying is that the DNA preferentially invades and kind of assists the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer cells because they have an advantage in proliferation .\nThey \u2019 re more likely to spread and to live and survive .\nThey know which cells are immortal , and it goes into those cells .\nThat cells is basically going to cause cancer .\nDr. Deisher : Right .\nFrom the gene therapy experts [ who \u2019 ve ] published stacks of papers on this , the fragments are readily taken up by blood stem cells where they \u2019 ll insert .\nThey \u2019 ll give that blood stem cell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take over and become the dominant stem cell making most of our blood cells .\nWhenever you have an insertion , that \u2019 s a mutation in and of itself , but what commonly happens is that it causes other mutations to occur because it messes up how the DNA is read .\nInsertions cause mutations as well .\nKennedy asked about when the cancer might show up in someone at risk .\nDr. Deisher : It doesn \u2019 t have to show up immediately .\nIt could show up years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials that in some of these young boys who basically got the contaminants of the vaccine , human primitive DNA fragments , and there was a retrovirus in there too , \u2026it took a couple of years in some of them .\nSome it was weeks , some it was years\u2026 .\nNext the discussion turned to retrovirus damage from the MMR and chicken pox vaccines which are made from animal cell lines .\nKennedy : When you look at autism , do you see an autoimmune disease ?\nDr. Deisher : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a significant number of children have a general brain inflammatory abnormality and could certainly be driven by autoimmunity .\nKennedy asked about the effects of injecting male or female DNA into the opposite sex .\nDr. Deisher : I don \u2019 t know because you are not going to get a full gene injected .If you look at people with gender dysphoria , 84 percent of those people are on the autism spectrum .\nMaybe it \u2019 s more due to that generalized autoimmune disease or something\u2026 .\nKennedy : Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDr. Deisher : We have , very closely .\nKennedy : How many of those contain fetal tissue ?\nDr. Deisher said she wasn \u2019 t following that too closely , but she did say that it is going to be very difficult to come up with an effective vaccine against corona virus .\nThere hasn \u2019 t been a successful vaccine made against a corona virus yet .\nThis virus has mutated fairly significantly .\nThe disease has become less severe .\nThat \u2019 s a natural lifespan of a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal influenza where it \u2019 s going to re-emerge seasonally .\nEven if a vaccine were to be made that \u2019 s safe and effective\u2014the most effective influenza A vaccine is only 45 percent [ effective ] \u2026 We \u2019 re focused on a treatment for those who \u2019 ll become severely ill. Our focus has not been on vaccines or on anti-virals , but on treating those patients .\nKennedy brought up the safety of the mRNA COVID vaccine .\nDr. Deisher : I think the mRNA vaccines are definitely a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral vaccine , absolutely .\nI don \u2019 t know how they would compare to the DNA vaccines .\nThey \u2019 re new .\nWe \u2019 re going to have to see .\nThey \u2019 re rushing these vaccines forward .\nHow are they going to get safety testing ?\nThey \u2019 re proposing human challenge studies .\nThat is so unethical , that people would actually volunteer to be injected with live coronavirus to see if the vaccine works .\nThere \u2019 s such a panic and a rush .\nI think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing to treat those most severe while they take a couple years and make a safe and effective vaccine .\nKennedy then asked if officials were more interested in focusing on a patentable vaccine rather than therapeutic drugs .\nDr. Deisher : I think they \u2019 re looking at everything .\nThe thing that is attractive in vaccines and it can get people to kind of put blinders on is that it is a cost effective way to protect the world .\n\u2026It is something you can afford to give to everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have blinders on .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely we \u2019 re going to have an effective vaccine , and 45 percent effectiveness , actually most vaccine experts , you \u2019 d use it but they don \u2019 t consider that effective .\nYou know effective , it is going to be 80 percent , 90 percent .\nIt \u2019 s a cost effective way to try to protect the world , so that \u2019 s why people like it .\nKennedy mentioned the Cochrane Collaboration looked at the flu vaccine and they concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s kind of a deceiving number because people say that means out of every hundred people 47 will not get the flu .\nActually very few people actually get the flu , maybe five percent .\nCochrane Collaboration said they have to give a hundred flu shots to avert one case of the flu .\n\u2026 The British Medical Journal , the editor , Peter Doshi , came back and said the same thing .\nHe said flu shots are very , very ineffective .\n\u2026 There \u2019 s no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented .\n\u2026 Then referencing the coronavirus vaccine , Kennedy said , They \u2019 re testing on these very elite groups who do not look like the American people .\nThey don \u2019 t have comorbidities .\nFifty-four percent of Americans have chronic disease .\nNobody in the test group has diabetes , none of them are smokers , none of them are vaping , none of them are drinking , none of them have asthma or rheumatoid arthritis .\nNone of them are fragile or elderly .\nEven if we could prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , which so far we haven \u2019 t seen or that it \u2019 s effective , you \u2019 re not proving that you \u2019 re actually averting deaths with it .\nWhat I worry about is they \u2019 ll test it on those groups , they \u2019 ll say it \u2019 s safe and effective , and then they \u2019 ll give it to everybody .\nIt may have very , very different effects in fragile elderly .\nIt may even do pathogenic priming and make them even more likely to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not see any problems with it .\nThe surveillance system is designed to fail .\nDr. Deisher : I agree .\n\u2026 Effectiveness and efficacy are two different things .\nOne measures do you make antibodies , but making antibodies doesn \u2019 t say anything about do you block the disease .\nSo in many years the vaccines were thirteen percent or whatever , and since not everyone gets the flu , you have to inoculate a lot more people and there \u2019 s a lot of other stuff in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think when we get up to the numbers where it \u2019 s 45 to 50 percent efficacious , that means they make antibodies that block the influenza , that the scales tip a little bit .\nYou \u2019 re also right , they \u2019 re not really preventing deaths , and that \u2019 s where we \u2019 re focused .\nWe \u2019 re focused on a treatment for those people who are going to get severely ill whether there \u2019 s a vaccine or antivirals .\nThey \u2019 re not being helped .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza as well as for the coronavirus .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

found because it mutates , saying scientists ' great fear was that coronavirus could be the same .\nIn that case , he said 'there is nothing we could do apart from social distancing forever ' - a prospect William described as 'frightening ' .\nThe Oxford vaccine has a shaky history , funded to the tune of \u00a390m million by the British government and taxpayer , and already in manufacture in billions of doses , the human trials began in April amid false reports that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product is arguably commercially too big to be allowed to fail .\nIt also has the advantage that its lead developer Andrew Pollard heads the committee that will advise the British government on its use .\nAdmittedly , last week he was in an apparently non-committal mood in conversation with Prince William : Having systematically screwed up the hydoxychloroquine ( HCQ ) trials for the treatment of the Covid virus and otherwise prevented its general use , all of which likely ended up in countless unnecessary deaths ( see Dr Meryl Nass 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning their attention to the first crop of vaccines , created at reckless speed with new technologies .\nThe WHO 's chief scientist told Reuters on Friday : Given his position as chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation it may be getting ahead of himself to show too much enthusiasm at this stage , but the world deserves better than this false alternative .\nNor would anyone be very surprised if he gives the product the go-ahead when the time comes .\nAs if to make the point director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on CNN yesterday he would settle for a vaccine which gave 70 or 75 % immunity .\nSwaminathan also has her eye on the Moderna vaccine which goes ahead despite the fact that it passed over animal trials altogether and had a 20 % serious adverse rate in its initial human trial , as reported by Robert F Kennedy , Jr .\nUnlike HCQ it is impossible to see how there could be any true assessment of safety and effectiveness of these products for years to come .\nAnd it is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested providing their corporate sponsors are pleased .\nBoth Moderna and the Oxford consortium have the backing of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation among others .\nBack in December Swaminathan came to attention because of her contradictory fronts at the WHO vaccine safety summit where she had one message for the public : '' Vaccines are very safe .\nIf someone gets sick after vaccination it is usually either a coincidence , an error in administering the vaccines , or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself.That 's why we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems allow health workers and experts to react immediately to any problems that may arise .\nThey can examine the problem rigorously and scientifically look at the data and then promptly address the problem .\n`` WHO works closely with countries to make sure that vaccines do what can do best to prevent disease without risks .\nNew vaccines against malaria , meningitis and encephalitis in Asia and Africa are now being thoroughly monitored with support from WHO .\nVaccines are one of the safest tools we have to prevent disease and ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' And a rather more candid one for the conference : '' I think we can not over-emphasise the fact that we really do n't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we 're not able to give clear cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths which have occurred to particular vaccines and this always gets blown up in the media - one should be able to give a very factual account to what exactly has happened and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases there is some obfuscation at that level and therefore there is less and less trust then in the system ...\nPutting in place the mechanisms , whether they are cohort studies or whether they are sentinel surveillance sites to be able to monitor what is going on and report back and then for corrective action to be taken because unexpected things could arise after introduction and one always has to be prepared as we have seen .\nYou know the history of many drugs you 've heard about , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs have been licensed and introduced into the population.So I think that the risk is always there and the population needs to understand that and feel confident that mechanisms are being put in place to understand some of those things . ''\nPerhaps one might add that the monitoring systems in the developed world may be even more efficient at processing out serious events than undeveloped , AND WHAT WE ALL NEED NOW IS STRAIGHT TALKING .\nADDENDUM : It has just been drawn to my attention that Prof Andrew Pollard recused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 7 May ( minutes published 18 June ) to discuss the COVID crisis because of his conflict as developer of the Oxford vaccine : this may be viewed as a surprise since the Oxford Vaccine Group of which he is director was involved in research or development of manifold products that have been recommended to the schedule by the JCVI , notably in his second meeting as chair in 2014 recomending the Bexsero Men B vaccine to the the infant schedule for which he himself was lead developer .\nIt remains problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretaries of State for Health and Social Care , and to be seen whether the process becomes any more credible as a result ( or whether they are just covering their backs ) .\nHis role has been taken by Prof Wei Shen Lim one of the directors of the controversial Oxford Recovery Trial which included the discontinued trial of HCQ .\nThe website for the trial records .\nThis trial is supported by a grant to the University of Oxford from UK Research and Innovation/National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford Biomedical Research Centre , Wellcome , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the Department for International Development , Health Data Research UK , the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit , and NIHR Clinical Trials Unit Support Funding .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/FQ6JKkix6YI/whos-lead-scientist-soumya-swaminathan-places-chief-hope-in-oxford-and-moderna-vaccines.html", "published": "2020-06-30T06:01:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1593511260, "collection_utc": 1593613608}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-06-30--Dr. Meryl Nass on How a False Hydroxychloroquine Narrative was Created", "date": "2020-06-30", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Dr. Meryl Nass on How a False Hydroxychloroquine Narrative was Created", "content": "Note : Excerpted from Dr. Meryl Nass MD 's blog .\n# #

Kennedy , Jr. interviewed the founder and president of Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute , Dr. Theresa Deisher , on the use of aborted fetal cells in medical research .\nMr. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of topics including what the existing research tells us in terms of health risks , and what alternatives might be used in place of human DNA .\nAt 12 minutes and 35 second on the video , you \u2019 ll learn about the medical use of human fetal cells .\nKennedy : How do those get in the vaccine ?\nDr. Deisher : A vaccine is basically a long string of either RNA or DNA , the virus .\nIt \u2019 s too long to make economically in a test tube , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of replicating viruses .\nThey infect cells and the virus grows in the cells .\nAt the end of that process they try to purify the virus away from the cellular material , but most people understand there \u2019 s a give-and-take between purity and amount .\nIf they were to purify away all of the fetal cell line contaminants , the yield of the virus would be so low no one could afford it .\nIt \u2019 s that balance between yield and purity that results in actually very high levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe discussion turned to the dangers in this practice .\nDr. Deisher : The fetal DNA is what \u2019 s considered primitive DNA , viral DNA is primitive , fetal DNA is primitive .\nWhen I say primitive , DNA is not just ATCG .\nIt is decorated .\nIt is decorated with sugars , methyl groups , and other additions like nitrosyl groups that are put onto the DNA that regulate how the DNA is used and that decoration is entirely species specific .\nSo if a chicken cell is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments in the final product , but those are decorated like a chicken , our body will recognize them as foreign and eliminate them .\nIf they were to get into a human cell they could not incorporate into the DNA , they just can not .\nThey actually don \u2019 t even get taken out to any extent .\nNext Kennedy asked about the specific vaccines that contain human fetal cells and why human cells were ever used in vaccines in the first place .\nDr. Deisher : Currently the MMR vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shingles vaccines , \u2026 all Hepatitis A containing vaccines are made in fetal cells , some polio-containing vaccines and some rabies-containing vaccines .\nPeople can go to our website https : //www.soundchoice.org/ and pull down a list of the vaccines .\nInterestingly Sanofi just switched the manufacture of their polio and polio-containing vaccines away from human fetal cells to an animal cell .\n\u2026 Dr. Deisher addressed the question of why vaccine makers started using human fetal cells .\nI think it \u2019 s complicated .\nThe animal rights movement was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickenpox could have been manufactured in a guinea pig cell line , but there \u2019 s quite a bit of objection to using animals for research .\nThe animal activists were definitely driving them to go and use the bodies of aborted babies .\nEconomically they thought that it would be cheaper .\nIt \u2019 s not though because the regulatory aspects are so much higher .\nIt turns out making the virus costs less than 10 cents .\nVialing the virus is the cost .\nThat \u2019 s 10 dollars .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically for them .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s kind of weird to think that the animal rights activists have more clout with the vaccine companies than do the anti-abortion activists .\nDr. Deisher : They do , and what \u2019 s really alarming is the lack of outcry over human babies , born alive at five to six months old , so that their hearts can be obtained beating , and they have to be beating to be used in the research that \u2019 s being done .\nIf the heart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou can not use it .\nSo these babies are delivered alive and their hearts cut out without anesthesia .\nI wouldn \u2019 t do that to a mouse .\n\u2026 Kennedy : And they are surgically killed ?\nDr. Deisher : Their hearts are cut out or they cut through their faces to get good brain tissue .\nKennedy : Stanley Plotkin \u2026 used about seventy-five fetuses to make the many vaccines he was involved in .\nHe said that they used the entire fetus .\nThe fetus was aborted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They used the tongues , they used the eyes , they used all the parts of the fetus .\nIs that true or do they just use the heart and the brain ?\nDr. Deisher : They use the baby and certain scientists will purchase the heart , another scientist will purchase the brain .\nThey purchase the legs or the eyes .\nThe body parts are sold for research .\nI got a catalogue twenty plus years ago .\nI \u2019 ll never forget the prices .\nThirty-two week old baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early deliveries survive at 21 weeks now so we \u2019 re talking about viable babies .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s hard not to start talking about this as morally revolting .\nIt is difficult not to talk about the moral implications of this .\n\u2026 Let \u2019 s go back and talk about the science and I \u2019 ll try to get over what I just heard .\nKennedy asked Dr. Deisher about the effects of using human cells in vaccines versus animal cells .\nKennedy : A lot of the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the human blood supply and the human genome , like the XMRV virus which causes leukemia .\nThey didn \u2019 t know it was in mouse brains , and a lot of the monkey viruses like SV40 which was in all the polio vaccines , which is also a very potent carcinogen .\nThey weren \u2019 t able to detect those animal viruses , retroviruses prior to the vaccine being made .\nI think one of the justifications to switching to human was that you were less likely to get retroviruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated issue .\n\u2026They didn \u2019 t know that there were retroviruses in the animal cell lines at that time .\nThat knowledge came later with better detection techniques .\nWith the information they had at the time they thought they were doing the best thing .\nThey debated it for fifty years before they allowed it .\nWe \u2019 ve learned so much from gene therapy and immunology that it \u2019 s time to take another look .\nKennedy : When you use animal tissue the animal DNA is recognized as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reject it and excrete it .\nWhen they started using fetal tissue , the fetal tissue is not recognized as foreign .\nWhat are the implications of that ?\nDr. Deisher : In a certain number of people it won \u2019 t be recognized as foreign because it \u2019 s primitive and it has fewer methyl groups on it than a normal person would have or an adult .\nFor example human fetal DNA enters your body and you are most likely going to mount an immune response to it when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not self .\nIt \u2019 s fetal DNA .\nIt \u2019 s primitive .\nIn people who have a genetic predisposition to have lower methylation of their DNA , hypo methylated DNA like if they have an MTHFR mutation , they will mount a response likely to the human fetal DNA .\nThe antibodies are going to be for hypo methylated DNA and that person has hypo methylated DNA so they would have a high chance of having a cell self attack because of the antibodies that they make to the primitive fetal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , even an adult has a genetic predisposition so that their own DNA is a more primitive kind of DNA , it has hypo methylated status , then antibodies to the fetal DNA could turn around and attack the person \u2019 s own body .\nKennedy : Hypo means less .\nIt means it has less of a methylation capacity and methylation capacity is the capacity to process sugars and proteins \u2026 Dr. Deisher : Methylation controls how genes are used .\nIn a fetal state you \u2019 re using lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an adult state you don \u2019 t want to use all of the genes that you used during development because you \u2019 re not going through development anymore .\nYou \u2019 re a born organism .\nYou \u2019 re going to want to turn on other genes .\nThe fetal genes after birth get more methyl groups put on them so they \u2019 re not used .\nWhat happens if you use those methyl groups later on is you can get cancer or you could get an autoimmune disease .\nKennedy brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people who have the MTHFR gene .\nHe added the vaccine industry claim that not enough of the DNA gets into the person being vaccinated to be harmful .\nDr. Deisher : Anyone who says that doesn \u2019 t know anything about immunology or virology or they would never make such a statement .\nI don \u2019 t think most people even know how viruses in vaccines work .\nDr. Deisher focused on what happens during pregnancy .\nAs the pregnancy goes on the placenta breaks down , and what happens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in the mother \u2019 s circulation .\nWhen they reach a certain level they trigger an immune receptor .\nIt \u2019 s called Toll-like receptor 9 .\nThat \u2019 s the same receptor that viruses in DNA vaccines trigger .\nKennedy : It \u2019 s actually an auto-immune response .\nYou \u2019 re notifying your body that the placenta\u2014that placenta is a foreign invader and I need to get rid of it .\nThat \u2019 s what causes women to go into labor .\nDeisher : Exactly .\nAntibodies are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placenta and they attack , and that triggers labor .\nThat \u2019 s a massive auto-immune rejection , right ?\nOr immune rejection .\nThat \u2019 s how you get your baby and that \u2019 s a good outcome .\nWhen we inject infants and young children with the amount of fetal DNA in the vaccines , they have levels in their blood , concentrations higher than the levels that trigger labor .\nYou can \u2019 t tell me that that is not going to cause an immune response .\nAbsolutely it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response .\nAnyone who says different does not know what they \u2019 re talking about or they \u2019 re not telling the truth .\nKennedy : What you \u2019 re saying is you \u2019 re putting enough DNA into that baby at that same level , less levels of foreign DNA cause a woman to mount an autoimmune response against the placenta and excrete it .\nAn even greater level that occurs in a vaccinated individual might be causing actual autoimmunity in those children .\nDeisher : It \u2019 s going to elicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that immune response if the person is genetically susceptible to having under methylated , low methyl DNA , then they \u2019 re in danger that they could have a later autoimmune response .\nIt could be within days , it could be months down the line .\nThere would have to be exposure of that person \u2019 s own DNA .\nIf that was exposed then you \u2019 re got antibodies that are going to recognize it as foreign and attack that person \u2019 s own organs .\nIt could be 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time frame .\nAs long as those antibodies remain in the body , and antibodies will be around for 10 , 20 maybe even up to 30 years , that person , if they have their own DNA exposed , could end up with an autoimmune disease .\nKennedy brought up Dr. Paul Offit \u2019 s claim that the amount of the vaccine ingredients is so small it can \u2019 t impact the human body .\nActually that vaccine is intended to permanently alter the immune system of that child .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s how they sell it .\nThere \u2019 s actually a difference\u2026 Autistic kids where they have those particular DNA strands or antibodies , antibody reactions to the DNA can be found in kids with autism and not in other kids .\nDr. Deisher : There are scientific publications that [ say ] that about 35 to 40 percent of children with autism have an immune response to human DNA .\nIt means they had to have been exposed to human DNA at some point that triggered them to mount a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have those antibodies .\nKennedy : Actually the timing of when they started putting fetal DNA into the MMR vaccine was also perfectly correlates with the first change points for the escalation and climb of autism rates in American children .\nDr. Deisher : It does .\nAbout 1979 , 1980 .\nNext Kennedy moved on to talk about cancer .\nDr. Deisher : Some of the human cell lines have been immortalised , but others are just sort of assumed immortal .\nKennedy : Just so people know , by immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey \u2019 ve been essentially rendered cancerous .\nThey will never die .\nThey continue breeding and living which makes it easier to grow cultures on them .\nDr. Deisher : One has been transformed with Epstein-Barr virus .\nThat \u2019 s immortal .\nIt \u2019 s called the HEK293 in their cell lines , but the lines used in vaccine manufacture are largely not immortal and they \u2019 re reaching the end of their life span .\nSo people are making new fetal lines to replace them .\n\u2026 They used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HEK293 cell .\nThe HEK293 cell line isn \u2019 t mused to make the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s a line called MRC5 and WI38 that are predominantly used .\nDr. Deisher noted that the fetal cell lines were from babies aborted in the late 1960 \u2019 s and \u2018 70 \u2019 s .\nKennedy : Could these vaccines be causing cancer in children ?\nDr. Deisher : The other danger of having the primitive , low methylated human DNA fragments we know about from the field of gene therapy .\n\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fragments of DNA to correct gene mutations .\nThey correct the mutations in stem cells , and then they give the stem cells back to the person with the gene mutation .\nIt turns out that if you give the DNA fragments to the body , we call them invivo , you inject them into a vein , stem cells love to take them up if they \u2019 re from a primitive source like a fetus or a placenta or sperm .\nIf they \u2019 re from an adult , they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens is they readily insert into the genome of the stem cells that take them up .\nIf you do mouse experiments 100 percent of the mice will take up those DNA fragments .\nAnytime you have an insertion , that \u2019 s a mutation .\nIt turns out from what the gene therapy field learned , \u2026those primitive DNA fragments like to insert in areas of the genome where they give that cell an advantage or a proliferation advantage .\nOur blood cell formation is a phenomenal biology .\nWe have trillions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight parent stem cells typically make all of the other stem cells that give rise to all of those working trillions of blood cells .\nSo you mutate a stem cell , it gets an advantage and it tends to take over and so instead of having eight cells making all the blood cells , you \u2019 ll have one , the one that got the survival advantage .\nWe have situations where we have eight blood cells , eight stem cells making all of our blood cells .\nThat \u2019 s called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you have monoclonal .\nOne cell takes over that aren \u2019 t cancer .\nIt happens in some forms of heart disease .\nIf you have an mutation in that one stem cell , because you have an insertion , you \u2019 re at high risk to have another mutation , and that becomes cancerous , that \u2019 s very dangerous .\nWe know from gene therapy trial that happened and four of nine of boys got cancer .\nScientists like Dr. Offit and Plotkin , those kind of people estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 .\nIt means we would have to treat more children than exist before we would ever see harm .\nThe real data said four of nine .\nThey were way off .\nI wouldn \u2019 t listen to anything they say about safety .\nKennedy : So what you \u2019 re saying is that the DNA preferentially invades and kind of assists the cells that might be leukemia cells or cancer cells because they have an advantage in proliferation .\nThey \u2019 re more likely to spread and to live and survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it goes into those cells .\nThat cells is basically going to cause cancer .\nDr. Deisher : Right .\nFrom the gene therapy experts [ who \u2019 ve ] published stacks of papers on this , the fragments are readily taken up by blood stem cells where they \u2019 ll insert .\nThey \u2019 ll give that blood stem cell a proliferation or survival advantage so that it could take over and become the dominant stem cell making most of our blood cells .\nWhenever you have an insertion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , but what commonly happens is that it causes other mutations to occur because it messes up how the DNA is read .\nInsertions cause mutations as well .\nKennedy asked about when the cancer might show up in someone at risk .\nDr. Deisher : It doesn \u2019 t have to show up immediately .\nIt could show up years later .\nWe know from the gene therapy trials that in some of these young boys who basically got the contaminants of the vaccine , human primitive DNA fragments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , \u2026it took a couple of years in some of them .\nSome it was weeks , some it was years\u2026 .\nNext the discussion turned to retrovirus damage from the MMR and chicken pox vaccines which are made from animal cell lines .\nKennedy : When you look at autism , do you see an autoimmune disease ?\nDr. Deisher : I do .\nThere \u2019 s good evidence that a significant number of children have a general brain inflammatory abnormality and could certainly be driven by autoimmunity .\nKennedy asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female DNA into the opposite sex .\nDr. Deisher : I don \u2019 t know because you are not going to get a full gene injected .If you look at people with gender dysphoria , 84 percent of those people are on the autism spectrum .\nMaybe it

\u2019 t been a successful vaccine made against a corona virus yet .\nThis virus has mutated fairly significantly .\nThe disease has become less severe .\nThat \u2019 s a natural lifespan of a virus .\nWe think it may become like seasonal influenza where it \u2019 s going to re-emerge seasonally .\nEven if a vaccine were to be made that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine is only 45 percent [ effective ] \u2026 We \u2019 re focused on a treatment for those who \u2019 ll become severely ill.

\u2019 ve never allowed ourselves to ask the question : If the vaccines cause inflammation acutely , do they continue to create inflammation chronically ?\nThe representatives should have been more than a little worried over the statistics Dr. Palevsky cited .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing is a large outbreak of neurodevelopmental disabilities in adults , including Alzheimer \u2019 s , and one of the main factors that they \u2019 re finding in the brains of people with Alzheimer \u2019 s is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the vaccines that we \u2019 re giving .\n\u201c \u201c We have never studied whether the aluminum we \u2019 re giving in vaccines gets into the brain , and we \u2019 ve never measured whether it stays in the brain , and what it does if it does stay in the brain.\n\u201d Larry Palevsky , MD answered questions for 28 minutes .\nHe described the appalling lack of studies when it comes to vaccine safety , especially involving the use of aluminum in vaccines and its damaging impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was hearing by the Connecticut Assembly on vaccine safety .\nThere should have been a packed chamber and lots of press coverage because what

presentation to the CT Assembly last February , during which time the religious exemption was in jeopardy .\nThen ... COVID .\nBy Anne Dachel Nightmare in Connecticut \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one in 10 with ADD/ADHD , one in 35 with autism , one in 11 with asthma , and one in 20 under the age of five with seizures.\n\u201d For me personally , the most encouraging part of Dr. Palevsky \u2019 s remarks was what he said about an upcoming vaccinated versus unvaccinated study .\nHe described a colleague who was studying health outcomes in siblings , some of whom were fully vaccinated , some partially vaccinated , and some totally unvaccinated .\nThese are children who have the exact same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing different was the vaccines they were given .\n\u201c In his preliminary data he \u2019 s already seeing quite a stark statistically significance difference .\n\u201c Unvaccinated children are unanimously healthier with fewer chronic illnesses .\nThe next fewer illnesses are seen in the partially vaccinated children , and the most severe chronically inflamed conditions are seen in the fully vaccinated children .\n\u2026 \u201c Those vaxxed versus unvaxxed studies have never been done by the mainstream medical community or scientific community.\n\u201d I can \u2019 t think of a better example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hearing .\nAs a medical student starting in 1983 I was taught to critically think , and there are a couple of assumptions that we \u2019 ve heard today that I \u2019 d like to challenge .\nOne of the assumptions that we heard is that high vaccination [ rates ] protects those vulnerable and it reduces the probability of those people vaccinated to spread the germ to others .\nNever once in my thirty-seven years [ of medical practice ] have I ever seen a study that showed that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear from the body of those who are vaccinated .\nYet all we continue to say is that once a vaccine is given not only are people immune , but the bacteria and viruses are no longer in their bodies to transmit to others , and that is not true .\nWe also heard that once you are vaccinated , you are immune .\nWell actually the textbooks don \u2019 t say that .\nThe textbooks say that 2 to 10 percent of children who receive a vaccine actually don \u2019 t develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a whole number of children who will develop an antibody , but we don \u2019 t even know the percentage because they will develop the antibody but won \u2019 t be protected at all .\nSo there are more children who don \u2019 t develop protection from the vaccine than are actually unvaccinated in the state of Connecticut .\nWe are told that unvaccinated children are the only children and the only people that are capable of spreading germs .\nBut that \u2019 s not true either because vaccinated children can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the bacteria and viruses that we vaccinate against and so can adults .\nAdults can also carry the bacteria and viruses that we vaccinate against .\nWe are told that when you vaccinate , the bacteria and the viruses completely disappear from the earth .\nWell they don \u2019 t .\nThey change activity , they may mutate .\nWhen you heard before that the measles virus doesn \u2019 t mutate , well it does .\nThere are cases of outbreaks in Canada that have shown that a new virus came about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature that show that when a vaccine is given , you can induce a strain replacement , meaning that over time the bacteria and the viruses will mutate , but they don \u2019 t disappear from the earth .\nThey are still here .\nTheir activities change , and they may even mutate , and even those who are vaccinated can still carry them and transmit them .\nUnfortunately we are targeting 2 percent of the children who are not the sole carriers or transmitters of germs .\nVaccinations don \u2019 t stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they \u2019 ve been given the vaccine .\nMy last point : We heard that vaccines are unequivocally safe .\nWe have a public health crisis in our midst : chronic illness , brain damage , neurodevelopment disability , and there are chemicals in the vaccines that are shown in animal studies to contribute to this kind of brain inflammation that we are turning our backs on .\nWe are creating many of these children and we are ignoring it for the sake of continuing to vaccinate .\nThank you .\nNext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of mercury and aluminum in vaccines .\nYou heard earlier that there \u2019 s no real concern about aluminum because it \u2019 s such a small amount and so it really shouldn \u2019 t matter , but the kind of aluminum that we put into vaccines is a different kind of aluminum than we see environmentally .\nThis is called a nanoparticle .\nNanoparticles bind really tightly to the bacteria antigens , the virus antigens , the food protein antigens , and any other contaminates that are in the vaccines that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know [ about ] the biochemical properties of the nanoparticles is that they are capable of entering the brain .\nWe have not evaluated the safety of the aluminum nanoparticle and its injection and where it goes when it gets into the body and whether it gets into the brain .\nDo vaccine ingredients belong in the brain ?\nNo .\nDo they get into the brain ?\nNo one has ever studied it , but animal studies using the same chemicals that are in vaccines that we give to children directly demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain .\nWe are ignoring this information .\nThere are scientists in Europe who \u2019 ve actually done studies on the aluminum nanoparticle and have shown that it can persist in the brain for years and decades .\nWhat we \u2019 re seeing is a large outbreak of neurodevelopmental disabilities in adults , including Alzheimer \u2019 s , and one of the main factors that they \u2019 re finding in the brains of people with Alzheimer \u2019 s is the aluminum nanoparticle that \u2019 s directly related to the vaccines that we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the aluminum we \u2019 re giving in vaccines gets into the brain , and we \u2019 ve never measured whether it stays in the brain , and what it does if it does stay in the brain .\nWe do know that vaccines are supposed to cause inflammation in the body .\nWe have more than half of our children with chronic inflamed conditions , and we \u2019 ve never allowed ourselves to ask the question : If the vaccines cause inflammation acutely , do they continue to create inflammation chronically ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities , one in 10 with ADD/ADHD , one in 35 with autism , one in 11 with asthma , and one in 20 under the age of five with seizures .\nThe autoimmune diseases are exponentially rising , and we are finding that the viruses and the bacteria that we are injecting into the body , along with the adjuvants create something called molecular mimicry .\nWhich means the body sees those viruses thinking that it \u2019 s foreign but actually finds pieces of those viruses that match pieces of the self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiate between what \u2019 s it \u2019 s been told to reject and itself .\nSo it will turn the immune system on itself leading to an autoimmune condition .\nWe know this about Hepatitis B .\nWe know this about the Gardasil vaccine , and we know it about the flu vaccine , and we continue to say unequivocally that the vaccines have been studied effectively and that they \u2019 re safe .\nAnd that \u2019 s just not true .\nState Representative Jonathan Steinberg next asked Dr. Palevsky about the inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier .\nThere have been studies looking at the brains of people who had autism and those who didn \u2019 t , and compared the percentage of aluminum , and there was exponentially larger in those with autism and those who had no neurodevelopmental disabilities .\nI do want to mention that aluminum is not in vaccines in a vacuum .\nOne of the reasons aluminum is in there is to galvanize or catalyze an immune response against the antigens that are bond very tightly to it .\nIn every vaccine where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by polysorbate 80 , which is an emulsifier .\nAn emulsifier can go through both water and fat materials .\nAny of the experts I \u2019 ve ever asked , why is polysorbate in the vaccine , they have said , \u2018 to help disperse the vaccine material away from the vaccine injection site.\n\u2019 Polysorbate 80 is known as an emulsifier .\nIt \u2019 s also used by the drug companies to bind to drugs to assist drug delivery into the brain .\nSo polysorbate 80 can pass through the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn animal studies when using drugs bond to nanoparticles , bond to polysorbate 80 , you massively increase drug penetration into the brain than if you didn \u2019 t have the polysorbate 80 alone .\nPolysorbate 80 is a disperser .\nIt does move things away from the injection site , and it increases the potential for entry of whatever is attached to the polysorbate 80 into the brain .\nThere \u2019 s another chemical in the vaccines called 2 phenoxyethanol which actually disrupts the health of the cell membranes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a detergent in that respect , and yet we don \u2019 t study it to see what it does when it \u2019 s injected into the body , and whether it actually changes the cell membrane that would allow almost anything from the vaccine or even from the bloodstream to enter into cells or enter into the brain .\nWe know that aluminum as a nanoparticle can destroy mitochondria , and mitochondrial disease is one of the basic patho , physiological findings in people with chronicle inflammatory conditions .\nWe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste product removers of the cells .\nThose are called lysosomes .\nThose aluminum nanoparticles that can destroy the lysosomes change the way the cells remove wastes and inflammation , therefore you are increasing the potential for chronic inflammatory conditions .\nPolysorbate 80 can go right through the cell membrane .\n2 Phenoxyethanol can destroy the cell membrane and allow material to go in and anything bond to the aluminum can still go into areas where it shouldn \u2019 t go in .\nWhen you hear millions of parents , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear millions of parents saying , my child was fine and then deteriorated pretty badly .\nAnd you have millions of parents hearing from their physician , that had nothing to do with the vaccine , but the parent saw it right in front of them .\nIt \u2019 s our job to say , is there something in the vaccines that actually can penetrate the brain that can disrupt the mitochondria , that can destroy the lysosomes , that \u2019 s doing this ?\nIt can , and it most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at it .\nThese families are real .\nRepresentative Steinberg asked about the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate the blood\u2014brain barrier .\nIf you look at the pharmaceutical literature , the pharmaceutical literature says that number one , they have trouble penetrating the brain by delivering drugs because of the presence of the blood\u2014brain barrier .\nNumber two , if they attach a nanoparticle to the drug they can increase penetration of the drug into the brain .\nNumber three , if they put in an emulsifier like polysorbate 80 bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetration of the drug in the animal studies 20 fold .\nI don \u2019 t know what reference you have .\nI \u2019 d have to look at it , but there is scientific evidence to show that when an emulsifier like polysorbate 80 is bound to a nanoparticle and that bond to a drug , it can enhance delivery into the brain across the blood\u2014brain barrier , and vaccines are constructed in the same manner : polysorbate 80 , aluminum nanoparticle , bond to antigens that are in the vaccines .\nSteinberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the blood\u2014brain barrier .\nDr. Palevsky : 14:50 There have been numerous studies done by people outside the mainstream medical community who have attempted to look at what happens to the nanoparticle when it \u2019 s injected into the body .\nThey have found that not only does it penetrate the brain , it persists for years .\nSo again if we \u2019 re seeing a public health emergency of chronically disabled and chronically ill children , and we know there are ingredients in vaccines that can potentially contribute to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any scientific studies examining whether or not any of these ingredients contribute to the development of these chronic inflammatory conditions , we have a problem .\nSteinberg said Dr. Palevsky \u2019 s evidence showed a correlation , but not causation .\nHe pointed to the \u201c tens of thousands of chemicals we \u2019 ve introduced into our food , into our environment .\n\u201c Have we evaluated all those ?\nShould we be stopping all those ten thousand chemicals ?\nBecause they may be the cause of the presence of these various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Palevsky had failed to consider the effect of the chemicals on children .\nThere \u2019 s a difference between what you inhale and what you ingest and what you inject .\nWhat you inhale and what you ingest has the capacity for the immune system along the airway and the immune system along the 26 feet of intestines in children , plus the liver , to actually eliminate that before it gets into the body .\nWhen you deliver it through an injection one hundred percent of it gets in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what happens to it , and whether or not it stays in the body and what it does when it stays in the body .\nWhat does it bring with it , especially because we know that there are contaminants in vaccines like foreign cells , like foreign DNA .\nIn 2005 the FDA reported that they knew that there was foreign DNA in the vaccines , and they didn \u2019 t study it at all .\nThey did make a side note and say , we don \u2019 t know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage and it could , but we \u2019 re just going to tell you what the amount that \u2019 s legal for being in the vaccines .\nSo we don \u2019 t know everything that \u2019 s attached to these nanoparticles .\nWe assume that when you inject the vaccine , it \u2019 s not going to hurt you .\nWe also assume it \u2019 s going to give you immunity , and neither of those is true .\nSteinberg continued to argue that it was \u201c more likely \u201d that other chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise in childhood chronic illness .\nDr. Palevsky : The fact of the matter is that vaccine ingredients have never been tested for mutagenicity or carcinogenicity , and there are actually statements in the package inserts that say that this product has never been tested to see whether it causes mutations in the DNA or whether it causes cancer .\nSo you \u2019 re right , I think we should be equally concerned about the injection of these materials .\nI \u2019 ll say that in over 21 years of actually watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same community as the health of unvaccinated children , I don \u2019 t see nearly as many chronic inflammatory conditions in those who are unvaccinated as I do in those who are vaccinated .\nA colleague of mine is currently engaged in a wonderful study looking at the health outcomes of fully vaccinated children , partially vaccinated children and unvaccinated children .\nIn his preliminary data he \u2019 s already seeing quite a stark statistically significance difference .\nUnvaccinated children are unanimously healthier with fewer chronic illnesses .\nThe next fewer illnesses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most severe chronically inflamed conditions are seen in the fully vaccinated children .\nSo I think we do have observational data just by watching to see well , how many of the kids in the community who don \u2019 t vaccinated actually have cancer ?\nHow many do get cancer living in the same community who are vaccinated .\nThose vaxxed versus unvaxxed studies have never been done by the mainstream medical community or scientific community .\nI agree with you .\nI think environmental chemicals are definitely a concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just based on vaccinated versus partially vaccinated versus unvaccinated in the same communities .\nWe \u2019 re seeing it in the same families where you have parents who vaccinated their eldest child , saw very significant damage done to that child and then had two or three more children and did not vaccinate them or partially vaccinated them .\nThey have their own study because they see that their youngest who have not been vaccinated are far and away the healthiest , living in the same home , living in the same environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same exposure to parenting , same foods , same medical care and different health outcomes .\nMy experience is that the medical community refuses to acknowledge that there are faults with the vaccination system that are much greater .\nVaccine injury is much more widespread than we \u2019 re giving it credit for .\nWhen you have two to 10 percent of your children in the community who might not even develop an antibody , you already have a tremendous number of children who are not even immune .\nSo we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune , but vaccination doesn \u2019 t guarantee immunity , especially for those who don \u2019 t develop an antibody and then for those who do and don \u2019 t even get protection even if they do .\nIt strikes me that we \u2019 re sitting in a scientific community and we \u2019 re saying that if you vaccinate a child the virus or the bacteria just disappear from their body and they can \u2019 t transmit it anymore .\nThat has never been proven , but it is generally believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the science .\nSo we \u2019 re making a lot of assumptions : that the only people carrying the germs that we have to worry about are the unvaccinated because somehow the adults don \u2019 t carry it , somehow the vaccinated couldn \u2019 t carry it because they \u2019 ve been vaccinated , even though more than 10 percent of them might not be immune from it .\nSo there are a lot of assumptions here that I think we \u2019 re just agreeing to that really is not scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked why certain vaccines , like the flu vaccine and DTaP vaccine , are recommended for pregnant women when \u201c vaccine products have never been tested for safety during pregnancy.\n\u201d \u201c Does the recent study about flu vaccines and increased miscarriage rates concern you ?\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s definitely divergent views about whether the flu vaccine contributes to miscarriages .\nYou have the medical community that says no , and then you have increasing numbers of mothers , pregnant women who are saying , I was fine , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you hear the authorities say to them , unequivocally , no it had nothing to do with the flu vaccine .\nSo we \u2019 re losing experiential and observational data because our belief systems refuse to acknowledge that there may be uptick in the number of women who are undergoing miscarriages .\nThe thing about giving flu vaccine and Tdap to pregnant women basically supports the idea of cocooning , meaning that if you vaccinate the mother or the pregnant woman , she will be immune so that when the baby is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting pertussis basically .\nDiphtheria is really non-existent even though it \u2019 s around , it \u2019 s just not causing infections .\nVaccines don \u2019 t make the germ just disintegrate into thin air .\nIt \u2019 s also to prevent her from theoretically from developing the flu , but nine years ago , in the Vaccine Journal there was a study actually looking at flu vaccine in pregnant women , and it showed that women who are given the flu vaccine had increasing inflammatory markers .\nAnd nobody knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature that demonstrates that babies that are exposed to increasing inflammation in utero , have increasing incidents of schizophrenia and mental health disorders by teenage years .\nSo again , we \u2019 re not looking at long term effects of injecting material that does cause inflammation , and then again , if it does cause inflammation , how chronic is that inflammation ?\nDoes it persist , and then when you revaccinate and get further exposed to other factors in your environment that stress you , are you creating a downhill effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked about the lack of thorough testing of vaccines .\nYou heard before that vaccines are double\u2014blind randomized , placebo\u2014controlled studies , but they \u2019 re not .\nI would love to have the opportunity to work through the scientific literature to show that not one ingredient in vaccines has ever been injected into a group of kids with a control group that \u2019 s given a placebo .\nThat \u2019 s never happened .\nVaccines are not considered under the same standards of medicines .\nThey \u2019 re considered biologics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ] given permission to not study vaccines the same way medicines are studied .\nThey \u2019 ve also said publicly that it \u2019 s unethical to keep children unvaccinated during the study , so that \u2019 s why they say we don \u2019 t see studies looking at four weeks , eight weeks , 12 weeks , six months later .\nWe do have these surveillance studies , but if a child gets vaccinated at two years of age and then six months later , never having had asthma , starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s evidence in the literature how vaccines can favor the development of a wheezing illness , we have no data to actually say yea or nay .\nThat vaccine , in combination with what the kid got in the first two years , may have contributed to the onset of that chronic inflammatory condition .\nSo we are demanding that the proper safety studies be done , and we are told that they won \u2019 t be because we can \u2019 t leave children unvaccinated for any length of time .\nThen when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids who are unvaccinated who can be in the study , they say they don \u2019 t have same demographics , they don \u2019 t all have the same diets , they don \u2019 t have the same home environments , so we really can \u2019 t compare one to the other .\nBut we do have the families who have the fully vaccinated , partially vaccinated , and unvaccinated kids , and we don \u2019 t have the full study yet , but we have tremendous observational data that show that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @

"-- That old memory crossed my path today .\nI \u2019 d appropriately titled the entry This Blows .\nWritten during what looks like was an awful week over 10 years ago , I recently had a similar week full of struggles and emotions .\nBefore things smoothed out , I told myself the same thing I \u2019 d said a decade ago : Things really stink .\nBut you 'll pick yourself back up again , Cat .\nYou \u2019 ll see .\nI expected it to be a good week , but the week I wrote that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-thought out plans were completely destroyed .\nThen Ronan had dozens of seizures .\nThe night those came on was the worst , and the following day was no better .\nWalking around with more worry than with happiness , I asked myself how do I keep smiling when there 's nothing to smile about .\n...

try to work through them .\nAs usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d written that old memory : ...\nWhile I try to be upbeat and hopeful , there are days I just ca n't keep smiling .\nRonan looks so normal at first glance .\nStrangers are caught off guard when he does something unusual or has a meltdown .\nThose encounters can be painful , so I either try to explain things or quickly move away from watchful eyes .\nOn those bad days , I sometimes just want to blow off my responsibilities .\nI would never do that .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in some special way .\nRonan is my most needy most days and always gets my full attention .\nHis complicated medical issues and cognitive delays have us constantly on the go to get him to his therapies and appointments .\nMy life includes weeks that are tornado-like and should have high alert statuses to warn others what to expect ... Making sure all was well before tiptoeing back out in the world again , I left Ronan resting at home with his therapist on Friday morning .\nWalking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week had left behind - piles of laundry , empty cupboards , mail yet to be read and medical bills stacking up - I pulled out my To Do list .\nOverwhelmed , I saw that I had much to do .\nI also had a short amount of time to get it all done .\nRonan was in good hands , though , so I headed out.My first task was to get groceries .\nNeeding to stock up on bulk items , I headed to Costco .\nIn my own little world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long aisles getting the things we needed .\nWith still so much to get to on my To Do list but with little time to get everything done , I headed toward the exit after paying for everything .\nI had n't realized I was smiling as I got closer to the doorway , but my smile caught the eye of the older , happy fellow who 'd be charged to check customers \u2019 receipts .\nGrinning himself , he said , `` I can tell you 're going to have a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are .

Privileged to Repeat It", "content": "At the time the vaccine program was launched , the purpose was a national defense purpose , and they wanted to make sure that vaccines could be quickly formulated and deployed in order to derail attacks by foreign countries with biological substances .\nThe central one and the one we were most deeply concerned with was that vaccines in the United States were not safety tested .\nThey have an exemption that is not available to any other medical product , and that exemption which most people can not even believe , is an artifact of the CDC \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quasi-military agency .\nI began to address that and we started an organization that was trying to have a very limited scope which was trying to remove the mercury from vaccines .\nLittle by little I came to understand there were larger problems with vaccines .\nAround that time it came to my attention that there was also large amounts of mercury in vaccines , much larger exposures to children than any child would ever get from eating fish .\nBack in the early 2000s I was suing big coal burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharging mercury .\nAt that time my only concern was the impact of mercury on fish and on the human health of the human beings who ate the fish .\nLet me explain to you a little bit about the journey that brought me here .\nOn Friday , August 28 , Robert Kennedy , Jr. spoke at a press conference in Berlin , Germany announcing the expansion of Children 's Health Defense to Europe .\nKennedy 's words made it clear these are truly desperate times and no one can just sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own .\nVery powerful forces have an agenda and that agenda will affect the freedom of all of us .\nIt 's time to listen to Kennedy and to act .\nSo my very narrow purpose in starting the Children Health Defense was to address this problem and to get vaccines properly safety tested , because if they \u2019 re not safety tested , nobody can tell you with any medical authority whether that vaccine is injuring more people than it \u2019 s saving .\nAs we continued on with this advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other problems as well .\nThere [ were ] problems with the corruption in our political system .\nThe pharmaceutical companies had not only corrupted our politicians with huge amounts of lobbying money , they had captured the agencies that are supposed to protect Americans from public health threats : the CDC , the FDA , the HHS .\nThey had captured the press in our country by huge influxes of advertising dollars which had neutralized the press .\nThey had effectively subverted American democracy by neutralizing all of those institutions that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand between a greedy corporation and a vulnerable child .\nThe Congress had been corrupted .\nThe regulatory agencies were captured ; they had become the sock puppets for the industry they \u2019 re supposed to regulate .\nThe press had been sidelined .\nAnd worst of all , they had passed a law in our country in 1986 that gave pharmaceutical companies complete immunity from liability .\nSo there was no incentive for any of those companies to make vaccines safe .\nLittle by little we recognized that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global issue .\nTwo years ago when I was arguing the Monsanto case and I met my partner here Senta Depuydt .\nSenta already understood the connection that had taken me so long to formulate between toxics in our environment , the capture of our agencies , our political structures by those powerful companies .\nShe also recognized that pharmaceutical companies were the most powerful , more powerful than oil , more powerful than the chemical industry , and a greater threat , not only to our children \u2019 s health but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not [ only ] in the United States , but all around the globe .\nAnd I \u2019 m very glad that Tina Choy helped Senta to organize Children \u2019 s Health Defense Europe .\nWe are here today to announce the launch of the beginning of this organization .\nWe \u2019 ve been very , very successful in the United States , but we recognize that the pharmaceutical industry is operating and capturing politicians , running governments in every nation on the globe .\nIf we win this battle in just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re still going to lose it globally .\nSo we need people of good will , people who have courage , people who have a nonconformist way of thinking , who understand that we are being lied to , that the entire political structure today is saturated in pharmaceutical propaganda .\nWe have watched over the past few years something that is extraordinary .\nWe are at an inflection point , I believe , in human history , the largest and most critical inflection point in that humanity has ever encountered .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used the power of fear to engineer compliance in populations .\nI grew up understanding what happened in World War II in our country .\nDuring the Nuremberg Trials , Herman Goering was asked by the prosecutor , how did you make the German people comply ?\nGoering said , it \u2019 s not just Germany , this works in any country , whether it \u2019 s a fascist country or a communist country or a monarchy or a democracy .\nAll the rulers need to do is to tell the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fearful of .\nPoint a finger at that source of their fear and you can make human beings do anything you want .\nYou can make them go to the slaughter like sheep ; you can make them obey .\nDuring the same Great Depression that spawned Adolf Hitler we were very lucky in our country that we had a leader , Franklin Roosevelt , and he said , \u201c The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\n\u201d He understood that fear would drive us into totalitarianism .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci and Davos , and all these people who are running now the global economy , they have understood for years that they have a power that no totalitarian government has ever had available to it , which is the biosecurity .\nHitler could point at the Jews and say those are the big threat , we need to be frightened of them , and everybody else needs to obey so that we can fight them off .\nOther countries were scared of the Bolsheviks .\nIn the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans or dark-skinned people and say we need to be scared of them , or terrorists .\nAll of those things get us to voluntarily give up , relinquish our human rights , our civil rights and walk like sheep into the Abattoir .\nNow they have a source of fear that is the most pervasive , an all-encompassing power that they \u2019 ve ever had which is the fear of pandemic .\nGovernments love pandemics the same way that they love wars because it gives them power ; it gives them control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose obedience on human beings .\nToday we have an inflection of new technology that give governments the capacity to impose controls on populations that have never been imagined before in human history by any tyrant in history .\nWe have 5G which has created a surveillance state .\n5G is not here for your benefit .\nIt \u2019 s not here so [ it can ] make your life better because you can download your videogames in 6 seconds rather than 29 .\nThe only reason for 5G is because it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeffrey Bezos to harvest our data , to listen to your conversations on your cell phone .\nThey \u2019 ve always been able to do that , but there was no way for them to transport that data to subject it to analytics and then to monetize it and then to sell it .\nBill Gates today is building a city in Arizona , 80,000 people , with a data center that will be able to take all of this new data , the data on your Electus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electus is working for you ?\nShe is spying on you .\nYour cell phone is spying on you .\nThey have biometric facial recognition systems .\nYour GPS\u2014 Bill Gates brags that his satellites will be able to monitor every square inch of the planet 24 hours a day .\nThey have another innovation which is digital currency .\nAnd once they have digitalized our currency and gotten rid of the cash economy they have absolute control over us because they will be able to tax every transaction .\nThe banks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of wealth , every transaction , no matter how miniscule , no matter how small .\nAlso they \u2019 ll be able to enforce obedience because if you \u2019 re disobedient , they \u2019 ll be able to shut down your bank account and starve you , and you \u2019 ll no access to cash .\nMany people argue that this pandemic was a plandemic , that it was planned from the outset , it \u2019 s part of a sinister scheme .\nI can \u2019 t tell you the answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough evidence .\nA lot of it feels very planned to me .\nI don \u2019 t know , but I will tell you this , if you create these mechanisms for control , they become weapons of obedience for authoritarian regimes no matter how beneficial or innocent the people who created them .\nOnce you create them , they will be abused .\nA hundred percent guarantee that they will be abused .\nAnd all of the people who are out on the street now , who are arguing with this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us of authoritarian control , of people being told , \u201c Wear your mask.\n\u201d I think everybody in Europe , everybody in Germany , everybody in the United States , if they were told , here \u2019 s why you should wear a mask , here \u2019 s the science that says it will help , here is the science that says it works , that you will stop transmission to other people\u2014everybody would wear it with no problem .\nWhat we know is that we \u2019 re not being dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , this is the science , but it \u2019 s an appeal to authority .\nIt \u2019 s science because Tony Fauci and Bill Gates tell us it \u2019 s science .\nWe want to see the studies .\nWe want to see the studies on hydroxychloroquine .\nWe want to see the studies on whether the lockdown is killing more people than the coronavirus .\nWe want to see real science and real risk assessment .\nMy father told me when I was a child , \u201c People in authority lie.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in a democracy we need to understand that people in authority lie .\nPeople in authority will abuse every power that we relinquish to them , and right now we are giving them the power to micromanage every bit of our lives .\nTwenty-four hours a day they \u2019 re going to know where we are , they \u2019 re going to know the money that we spend , they \u2019 re going to have access to our children .\nThey \u2019 re going to have the right to compel unwanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that in the camps in World War II .\nThey tested vaccines on Gypsies and Jews , and the world was so horrified after the war , we signed the Nuremberg Charter .\nWe all pledged when we [ did ] that we would never again impose unwanted medical interventions on human beings without informed consent .\nYet in two years , all of that conviction has suddenly disappeared .\nPeople are walking around in masks when the science has not been explained to them .\nThey are doing what they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestrating obedience , and it is not democratic ; it \u2019 s not the product of democracy .\nIt \u2019 s the product of a pharmaceutical driven , biosecurity agenda that will enslave the entire human race and plunge us into a dystopian nightmare where the apocalyptical forces of ignorance and greed will be running our lives and ruining our children and destroying all the dreams and dignity that we hope to give to our children .\nThe launch of this organization , Children \u2019 s Health Defense , in Europe is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world that we are not going to take it .\nWe are building institutions to fight your institutions .\nYou have global institutions and we now have a global institution .\nAnd we are going to be out tomorrow with the biggest crowd in German history , and they \u2019 re all going to be saying\u2014peacefully\u2014the same thing : We are not going to let you take our democracy away .\nWe are not going to let you take our health away .\nWe are not going to let you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let you take our children away .\nI am very proud of the

enslaving so much of the human race .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/FQDpiMTO8Gw/those-who-remember-history-are-privileged-to-repeat-it.html",

Secretary of HHS allows certain licensed pharmacists who order and administer , and pharmacy interns ( who are acting under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist ) who administer , any vaccine that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommends to persons ages 3 through 18 .\nThis amendment was prompted by a report from the CDC in which it found a significant decrease in

advocate one evening .\nI could not believe it and thought it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I searched the internet to find a few articles dated August 19 th , 20 th and 21 st .\nThe Federal Register listed the action on Monday , August 24 , 2020 .\n[ 1 ] The 3rd amendment on August 24 th , allowing pharmacists to administer vaccines to children ages 3-18 .\nMany states had previously established restrictions on who could administer childhood vaccinations .\nWhile our nation was busy spending a considerable amount of time discussing racial inequalities ( as we should ) or whether or not public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or start on-line , or debating the upcoming national political conventions , our federal government , specifically , The Secretary of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) issued his 3 rd amendment to The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREP ) .\nThe Act was first enacted this year by a declaration from the Secretary of HHS on March 10 , 2020 .\nI mean no disrespect by that headline .\nBack in the day , even before my day , pharmacies had soda counters and the waiters were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the machines .\nSometimes the pharmacist was the soda jerk .\nPediatricians and their `` union '' the AAP must feel like their seltzer has gone flat , their Coca Cola has no more cocaine , their hot fudge went cold .\nHHS just authorized some pharmacists to administer PEDIATRIC vaccines .\nWe 're all familiar with the hard sales pitch to seniors at every grocery store and pharmacy compelling them with fear to get their flu , shingles and pneumonia shots while they wait for their Boar 's Head pimento loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thin they can read the newspaper through it . )\nNow , imagine the bounty of having parents line up their children for their vaccines , instead of going to a `` well '' visit .\nIn college , I studied marketing , and I still remember the 4 `` Ps '' Price .\nProduct .\nPromotion and PLACEMENT .\nAdding pharmacies is a huge shift in product availability .\nIt is much easier to bring Johnny and Janey to the Piggly Squiggly ( sic ) for Cocoa Puffs , Pop Tarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a busy , germy pediatric office where you have a co-pay , and may wait an hour or more to be seen by an overworked nurse and a doctor who might just have TikTwerked her desire to talk to your child alone in the exam room about this that or the other ... .\nAi n't that the cherry on top !\nI guess parents will have to weigh and measure their kids the old fashioned way , on a scale in the bathroom and with a marker on the laundry room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering this interesting development .\nNow with the federal announcement of this declaration , how will this play out in the states .\nHow much weight does this declaration have regarding state law which traditionally regulates the activities of state licensed pharmacists ?\nSo the question now to be answered , does this declaration by the Secretary of HHS supersede state law ?\nLast couple of years there were many legislation introduced that did not go anywhere in state legislatures around the country .\nIs this declaration a product of those failures ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air to signal to state health departments to use their rule making authority to modify statutes to allow pharmacies to enter the childhood vaccination arena ?\nEven my home state of Minnesota passed legislation in May 2020 to allow pharmacists to administer any FDA approved COVID vaccine to children as young as 6 years of age .\nThis is not a mandate , but rather setting up a horrible scenario for which pharmacists are clearly not trained to handle .\nThe method of passing legislation during a Peacetime Emergency declaration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling .\nThe PREP Act has been previously amended twice prior to this declaration .\nThe 1st amendment on April 10th to extend liability immunity to covered countermeasures authorized under the newly passed CARES Act .\n[ 3 ] This declaration provides limited immunity to manufacturers of masks , plastic shields , gloves and other protective equipment .\nThe 2nd amendment on June 4th for the purpose of clarifying that covered countermeasures include qualified countermeasures that limit the harm COVID-19 might otherwise cause .\n[ 4 ] Basically , allowing the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for COVID , to be used if necessary .\nNow the problems of allowing pharmacists to administer childhood vaccines .\nIn the Vaccine Court currently , the number one petition filed for compensation is for shoulder injury as the result of a vaccination ( SIRVA ) .\nMost of the injured persons ( adults ) received influenza or Tdap vaccinations from their local retail pharmacy such as Walgreens , CVS , RiteAid or Target .\nIf these retail pharmacies can not properly administer a vaccine to an adult , why would we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines are administered in the leg , not the arm .\nWill the pharmacies have the necessary facilities to allow the parent to undress the child ?\nProbably not .\nOne of the biggest problems when filing a petition claiming shoulder injury is the failure of the retail pharmacies to accurately record in the medical records which arm the vaccine was administered and who did it .\nThese pharmacies can barely keep up with adults receiving one vaccine at a time .\nWhat happens when a parent bring their child into the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacy tech or pharmacist record the date , time , which arm or leg ?\nProbably not .\nWill they be able to obtain and examine a thorough review of medical records prior to administering the vaccine ?\nProbably not .\nMost doctors lack any comprehensive training of what a vaccine injury is or adverse reactions by the child .\nLet alone a pharmacist receiving this type of training .\nThis has all the makings for a disaster .\nBut why is our government transferring the responsibility of administering vaccines to retail pharmacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinics ?\nIt just might be the pushback from doctors who claim it is not profitable or too costly to administer basic vaccinations in their office .\nFrom their point of view , it would be more cost effective in a pharmacy setting .\nOr is it something more sinister ?\nIt does appear that our government with pressure by Pharma is trying to \u201c gut \u201d the NVICP and slowly move injury compensation into the CounterMeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) .\nThis is clearly the landing spot for the COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole for those who are injured or have perished because of a vaccine .\nIf the public is withheld case decisions and information about CICP , then vaccine injury claims will no longer exist .\nSo many agendas by our government agencies and medical community without any regard for the best interest of the people .\nThe BIG problem here is The PREP Act being used as a vehicle to circumvent Congress .\nThe real concern , will we see a federal mandate for COVID vaccine at some point in the future via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiat without proper and necessary public comments and testimony .\nWill the PREP Act become the vehicle to advance vaccine policy in the United States ?\nI believe that we will see a few more amendments to The PREP Act if Congress will not address the liability issue for businesses , schools , colleges to open up .\nThere are lawsuits already filed by employees for wrongful death ( WalMart ) and hospitalizations of employees claiming being infected by COVID while employed .\nWe must remain vigilant , we must be prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected officials on a federal level , state and local level as well .\nThe PREP Act is in force as declared in March 2020 until October 2024 unless revoked by Secretary of HHS or POTUS .\nOr

.\nThere are technologies that are being introduced with this vaccine that can change the way we live , who we are and what we are and very quickly .\nSome people , that you might know these names : Elon Musk , who is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla automotive , as well as Ray Kurzweil , who is one of the big wigs of Google .\nThese are self-proclaimed transhumanists .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 , and they are very big proponents of this .\nThere [ are ] a lot of other people .\nYou might know their names .\nThey \u2019 re also involved with this , so you should look that up .\nI think the easiest way to explain this to you is to go with one of the front runners for the vaccine and go into a little bit of the history and tell you how they want to make the vaccine .\nI think that will speak volumes .\nFor instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the COVID 19 vaccine .\nYou should know that Moderna was founded by a person from Harvard , Derek Rossi , and this researcher actually was successful in taking some modified RNA and be able to reprogram a stem cell in the body and change the function of the stem cell .\nHe actually made it genetically modified .\nHe proved that you can genetically modify something by using modified RNA .\nSo they founded the company Moderna on this concept .\nIt \u2019 s kind of a new kid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been around that long .\nIn fact , [ Moderna ] hasn \u2019 t made any vaccine for a human before .\nIt \u2019 s made no medicine for a human before .\nThis will be their first run .\nYou must know that Moderna was in the news recently because it really fast tracked\u2014like the other companies , it \u2019 s fast tracking the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s going from phase one to phase two very , very quickly .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s going from phase one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March of this year until currently .\nThat is unbelievable .\nIt usually takes five or six years .\nHow are they able to do this with the safety and efficacy data that we need ?\nI want you to know that in phase two\u2026they \u2019 re only using between 35 and 40 humans .\nIn Moderna \u2019 s test study they only used 45 humans , and with the high dose vaccine group , \u2026100 percent of those people got systemic side effects .\nOne hundred .\nThat \u2019 s only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low dose vaccine [ group ] 80 percent got systemic side effects .\nWe don \u2019 t even know the long side effects from that .\nWe would need a lot longer time , right ?\nMaybe years .\nBut we do know , based on previous animal studies using this technology , you can expect possibly increased cancer rates , increased mutant genes , mutagenesis , also increased autoimmune reactions .\nFor instance , in some of the ferret studies , they saw that when the ferret was introduced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferret from , after the ferret got the vaccine , they actually had an exaggerated immune response .\nIt actually hurt the ferret .\nThey had more lung inflammation , more lung fluid , even some problems with their liver .\nIt actually hurt them .\nThey had a poorer response .\nThose are longer term reactions and that could be seen with this vaccine , but we don \u2019 t know the data yet .\nSo it \u2019 s not without risk .\nHow are they doing this ?\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLet me just explain how they would administer the vaccine .\nThere \u2019 s an idea called microneedle platform .\nThis was developed by MIT .\nThey said it could be very easily produced , mass produced .\nThis is why they \u2019 re proposing this technology and many millions of vaccines could be made quickly .\nThey could also be administered by yourself .\nThe idea is to get a Band-Aid , it looks like a Band-Aid you buy in the drug store .\nIt \u2019 s shipped to you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service .\nYou take it out of the package , you put it on your hand like this , and then you take the sticker off and voila , you \u2019 ve been vaccinated .\nHow is that possible ?\nIn this Band-Aid it has little tiny spicules , little tiny needles .\nThis was designed after a snake viper fang bite\u2026 So little snakebites .\nIn these little tiny spicules , they claim you [ won \u2019 t ] feel it that much , there are little hydrogel .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogel would be a luciferase enzyme as well as the vaccine itself .\nSo what is all that ?\nFirst of all , you \u2019 re getting the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s modified RNA or modified DNA .\nLet \u2019 s take Moderna , modified RNA .\nIn that modified RNA the idea is that the microneedles would puncture into your cell membrane and this synthetic piece of an RNA , it \u2019 s a code for the part of the virus , or they could use a synthetic DNA to code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go into your [ cell ] nucleus .\nYour body would start transcribing it , it would start reading it and making more of that part of the virus .\nWhy would we want to make more of the virus or part of the virus ?\nThe idea is your body would get used to seeing it , would know how to make antibodies and would have an improved T cell response .\nThe idea is then when you saw it in the future , your body would already know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better response .\nThat \u2019 s the idea .\nThe problem with that is they \u2019 re using something , a process called transfection .\nTransfection is a way that we make genetically modified organisms .\nI think you know about those fruits and vegetables .\nThey \u2019 re not as healthy as the normal , wild type of fruit and vegetable .\nSo possibly you could extrapolate that to a human .\nIf we became genetically modified we would not be as healthy .\nWe don \u2019 t have long term studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable .\nThe vaccine manufacturers have made the statement this will not alter our DNA , our genome .\nI say that is not true .\nBecause if we use this process to make a genetically modified organism , why would it not do the same thing to a human ?\nI don \u2019 t know why they \u2019 re saying that .\nIf you look at the definition of transfection it \u2019 ll tell you that it can be a temporary change in the cell .\nI think that \u2019 s what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s temporary .\nOr it \u2019 s a possibility for it to become stable , to be taken up into the genome .\nSo stable that it will start replicating when the genome replicates , meaning it is now a permanent part of your genome .\nThat \u2019 s the chance that we \u2019 re taking .\nSo it could be temporary or it could be permanent .\nWe would never know that for years down the road honestly .\nSo here we go .\nWe \u2019 ve got something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a possibility .\nAnd another thing on that , if they \u2019 re altering the genome , what would be the effects ?\nI told you previously some of the side effects , but also we need to know that this is a synthetic piece of DNA or RNA , and if it [ is ] taken up into the genome of a human , it \u2019 s synthetic , it \u2019 s not from nature .\nIf you look at the Supreme Court ruling on synthetic DNA or genes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners .\nSo what does that mean for us ?\nWhat if this gets into our genome ?\nDoes that mean that Moderna or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Department of Defense , all of these people who are involved in the patents are they somehow going to own parts of our genome ?\nIt \u2019 s a possibility .\nYou need to know that .\nThat \u2019 s one part of this delivery system , just one .\nNow let me go to the next .\nThe next part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme .\nThey named it , they patented it luciferase .\nI don \u2019 t like that name .\nLuciferase because it has bioluminescent qualities which means it can produce a light , or has a light source .\nAll of this would be under your skin and you can not see it .\nThe luciferase is an idea because they want to make sure that you \u2019 re vaccinated because they don \u2019 t trust medical records , they don \u2019 t trust you saying that you got vaccinated .\nThey want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that it was successful , a successful transfection , a successful gene modification .\nSo when you get the luciferase enzyme , if you have an iPhone or a special app on the iPhone , you can scan over that area and it will give a digital code , a digital imprint , a digital pattern , something that will identify that you were vaccinated .\nIt holds your vaccination record .\nIt also gives you an ID , a number , a bar code , a branding , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoo .\nIt \u2019 s all the same thing .\nYou now become like a product .\nSo we have that .\nThe third thing I mentioned was hydrogel .\nHydrogel is actually an invention from DARPA , the Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency .\nThis is kind of a sci fi kind of a group from the Department of Defense , Pentagon , of the U.S. government .\nThey make these fantastic inventions .\nSo one of them is hydrogel .\nHydrogel , you can look on You Tube .\nProfusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as hydrogel and you \u2019 ll find some little two minute clips that they describe .\nSo hydrogel is nanotechnology , microscopic little robots , and these little robots actually , I know it sounds crazy , it \u2019 s still crazy to me , but it \u2019 s possible , okay ?\nThey can disassemble , reassemble , assemble into and make different things .\nWith this hydrogel , it \u2019 s really nanotechnology , so that \u2019 s something robotic or something that \u2019 s artificial intelligence .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence .\nThis means that a human can now connect to directly and gather information from our bodies and connect with your smartphone , with the cloud , with some other smart device .\nOnce this is done , this is 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year .\nThink about that .\nThink about how immediately that could change our privacy .\nImmediately it could change our autonomy , immediately change our freedoms .\nThis can gather data like your blood sugar , your oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sound great .\nBut it also can gather many other things .\nIt can gather , they say , your emotions or your menstrual cycle , your activity , if you \u2019 ve fallen , your nutrients in your body , if you took medicines .\nIt \u2019 s a potential to see if you took illicit drugs .\nIt \u2019 s got a potential to see almost anything that goes on in your body .\nAnd all of this information is going where ?\nThat has not been addressed .\nWho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they using it for ?\nThis is really serious stuff , guys .\nThis is all being proposed to being unveiled in the next vaccine .\nThe other thing to know is with this nanotechnology hydrogel , artificial intelligence hookup , just like your cell phone , you can send a text message , you can send an email , but also you can receive them back .\nSo that means we could receive information .\nWhat information would be coming back into us ?\nWould it affect our mood , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , our memories ?\nIf you haven \u2019 t watched the movie Matrix , I think you should .\nI think there \u2019 s some truths in that , in that movie .\nI see so many wrong things with this vaccine , and I see that we are not talking about it in the major media .\nI feel that these companies are outright lying to us when they say they can not affect our DNA because by all definitions that they are using this can affect our DNA .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to get the point across , I wanted you to really do your own research .\nSo know that there are many risks that we \u2019 re seeing here .\nWe really need to know if we really want to go from Human 1.0 to Human 2.0 .\nLet me also tell you that there \u2019 s some major names behind these vaccines .\nYou \u2019 re always going to see like the Department of Defense from the U.S. government , sometimes DARPA , like I told you .\nWhy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation everywhere with this .\nIf you look , you \u2019 ll find that name almost always .\nLet \u2019 s go back to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nLet \u2019 s look at the track record .\nLet \u2019 s look at what that man stands for .\nHis family comes from a family of eugenics .\nWhat does eugenics mean ?\nPopulation control , meaning there are too many people on the planet .\nThat \u2019 s important to know .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks with a very good new vaccine we could get the earth \u2019 s population to be decreased by 10 to 15 percent .\nWell , who \u2019 s going to stay and who \u2019 s going to go ?\nAnd who is he to decide ?\nHe doesn \u2019 t have a medical background , no epidemiology background , no science background .\nHe \u2019 s not a doctor .\nSoftware tech .\nThat \u2019 s what he has .\nI \u2019 d also like you to realize , I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat are their motivations ?\nWhat is his motivation , right ?\nWe already know his family background .\nWhat \u2019 s very concerning to me is that DARPA , this military agency , as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , is very interested in something called \u201c Gene Drive \u201d research or technology , or \u201c Gene Extinction \u201d technology .\nIt \u2019 s exactly what it sounds like .\nBy using genetic mutations , by use of transfection for instance , you can exterminate an entire species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use this for mosquitoes , for instance , in Africa .\nBut our world is a delicate ecosystem .\nWho is saying one species goes ?\nYou destroy one species and you could affect an entire ecosystem .\nSo when you exterminate an entire species , you will affect an entire ecosystem .\nIt \u2019 s a very delicate balance .\nWho \u2019 s to say who \u2019 s going to stay and who \u2019 s going to go ?\nWho \u2019 s got that knowledge and why aren \u2019 t we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it to an insect , we can do it to an animal , we can do it to a human .\nI bring this up because if these agencies that are behind the vaccine also stand for that , do you trust them with your health ?\nDo you trust them with your family ?\nDo you trust them with our children ?\nThe other thing is we \u2019 re rushing this to production .\nWhat is the motivation behind that ?\nWe need to really think about this .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need to know , at least in the United States , there are mandates passed that make the vaccine manufacturers have no liability , zero liability for any harm done to any human .\nIf people are killed , if they \u2019 re hurt , if they \u2019 re paralyzed , if they \u2019 re maimed for life , it doesn \u2019 t matter .\nYou have no recourse , and they still make all their profit .\nSo there is no incentive for them to make it safe anyway .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ] one of the mandates in the Emergency Preparedness Act that says they can force a vaccine on us .\nThey can not force a vaccine if there is a viable treatment for the COVID 19 .\nI want you to know that doctors around the world are being censored about treatment options for COVID 19 or prevention for COVID 19 .\nIf there \u2019 s a true treatment or prevention then they can \u2019 t force this vaccine on us .\nI want to bring that up because what in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nIs it really [ for ] the health of all of us ?\nAs a doctor , I can \u2019 t see how this is in the true health of the entire world .\nI think there is another motive , another agenda going on .\nThe more I look at this , the more that comes up\u2026 .\nDo you really want to go to Human 2.0 ?\nI don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s the fantasy you see in the movies .\nWe need to come together and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in positions of power taking care of our health are not in our best interest .\nTogether we have power .\nTogether , united , our voice is strong .\nSo I encourage you to do critical thinking , do your own research , join groups in your state , go to your state legislature and you tell them no , no to these experiments on humans , no to invasion of privacy , no to censorship .\nWe are sovereign human souls .\nWe need to take our rights back .\n\u2026Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Age of Autism .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Chris Smith , who invited them to a meeting in his office in Washington .\nWithin weeks , a more organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invitation to another meeting in Washington , this time in New Jersey Senator Robert Toricelli 's office .\nGallagher remembers the date for this meeting vividly , April Fool 's Day , 1998 .\nAnd when she walked into the room she was astonished at how quickly plans had emerged .\nShe had expected again to play the role of supplicant , pleading with the government officials to take action .\nInstead , she found a prompt and aggressive action plan being put on the table .\nIn the room that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC who had come to the Senator 's office equipped with a multi-part plan , the first part of which was a prevalence study for Brick Township , an in-depth survey of the town 's autistic population that would pick up where Gallagher 's survey left off .\nCDC had identified a core team of staffers to lead the effort , including Jacquelyn Bertrand and Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp from the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities ( NCBDDD ) and Frank Bove from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnose every child with autism in Brick Township between the ages of three and ten years old .\nThey would start canvassing for cases and conducting interviews beginning with the start of the 1998 school year in September .\nAnd they planned to move quickly ( at lightning speed really ) , to have their initial results ready by the end of the year .\nThey were true to their word .\nTwo diagnosticians , Dr. Bertrand and Dr. Audrey Mars from the nearby Robert Wood Johnson Medical School , spent several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1998 .\nAnd by January 12 , 1999 , the CDC had confirmed the findings of Gallagher 's initial survey .\nOut of an initial estimated Brick population of 6,000 children from 3-10 years old , they had found over 40 cases of autism , giving a preliminary rate that was 12 times the estimated prevalence in the rest of the country .\n`` I think there is a cluster here .\nI do n't know why , '' lead investigator Bertrand said in an article by the Associated Press the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] it 's something that can be taken out of the community , that will be done , '' she said .\nAccording to AP she also added another intriguing tidbit : that `` the researchers are eager to solve the puzzle here because of escalating calls the last few years about possible , but less credible , clusters elsewhere in the nation . ''\nIt all seemed to Gallagher like a dream : the cavalry had arrived and somehow they were going to get to the bottom of the issue .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lines of communication with the CDC team went dark .\nAfter several months of intensive planning , intensive collaboration and rapid response , the CDC team told Gallagher that they were not at liberty to discuss the results with the parents any longer .\nAccording to Gallagher , one of the CDC staffers informed her that the mere mention of the word `` cluster '' had provoked a reaction from the higher ups within the CDC .\nApparently , there was now even a debate as to whether they could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalence rates .\nSo from January 1999 , until the release of the final study in April of 2000 , there was no more interaction with the CDC .\nNot a single word .\nPerhaps it was concern about the legal questions raised if there was indeed something in the water ( class action attorneys had begun recruiting local families ) .\nPerhaps the Brick results were n't a cluster after all but part of a larger pattern that caused a more generalized concern within CDC ( maybe it was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1998 the Lancet has published Andy Wakefield 's controversial study implicating vaccines in autism ) .\nBut there was no doubt about the silence coming from Atlanta .\nSomething had changed the behavior of the CDC team .\nAnd it raises an interesting question .\nWhat did the CDC learn about autism rates in Brick Township and what did they do with their newfound data ?\n-- In Part 2 : a discussion of the specific numbers in CDC 's Brick Township report and what they should have told the world about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brick .\nFrom the start of their activities in the Brick Township New Jersey autism study , the CDC 's approach had been nothing short of diligent and competent .\nThey responded rapidly to an expression of community concern and fielded a team that began what seemed to be all the right kind of work on the ground .\nThe team generated a response within weeks of mobilizing .\nThey held a press conference to express their support for community concerns about elevated autism rates .\nIf not a virtuoso performance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAfter their January 1999 press conference , the CDC team went underground .\nAfter many months of active communication and prompt response , they ceased all communication with Bobbie Gallagher and other member of the Brick POSSE that had first noticed the surprisingly high number of autism cases in 3-4 year olds in Brick .\nTeam members explained that higher-ups were concerned about the way the team had communicated their findings publicly , using the terms `` elevated '' and `` cluster '' in describing the autism situation .\nVague political rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity from Washington DC .\nBut whatever the cause , it was n't until well over a year later , April 2000 , that the CDC 's Brick study team would resurface .\nAnd when they did , all talk of a cluster was gone .\nAll concern expressed in mid 1997 for the surge in 3-4 year old kids ( who were 4-6 years old in 1998 ) was gone as well .\nPolitics and public relations priorities , it seems , had taken precedence .\nThere was , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1999 .\nThe team added more autism cases to its count of `` over 40 '' reported in their first press conference .\nBy the time of their final report in April 2000 , the CDC had identified 60 cases of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) in a population of just 8,900 children between the ages of three and ten .\nThis rate , 1 in 150 children , was the highest autism rate ever reported anywhere in the world up to that time , and might even have understated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC 's count left out quite a few families that had left Brick and that an approach that accounted for migration would have yielded over 70 cases .\nBut by early 1999 , the CDC team had virtually all the information it would ever get on autism rates in Brick .\nWhat did they do with that information ?\nThey had two questions they really needed to address in any final report .\nThe first was the issue of locally elevated environmental toxins : the kind of industrial contamination that might have provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSSE certainly believed that they had discovered a cluster .\nBobbie Gallagher thought that there was something in the water .\nAnd so there was great concern over specific chemicals that might be harming their unborn children .\nGallagher expressed skepticism that vaccines had anything to do with her own children 's autism .\n`` It 's possible that vaccines are a factor in some families , but I do n't think that 's what happened with my two children '' , she told me .\n`` I brought two autistic babies back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of local parents , the CDC team focused on water quality .\nAnd they had a specific hypothesis about the nature of the contamination .\nThe CDC team member from Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) had written a paper just a few years before that linked trihalomethanes ( THMs ) to a variety of birth defects , including neural tube defects .\nFrank Bove ( who according to Gallagher had two autistic children himself ) believed that these neural tube defects could be the key missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Patricia Rodier , a researcher from Rochester who had worked on toxins that she believed could cause neural tube defects in autism .\nAnd the ATSDR report on Brick went on at some length about their concerns over THMs ( a pervasive toxin that Bobbi Gallagher knew was elevated in the local water supply ) and neural tube defects .\nBut in Bove 's particular approach to the analysis of Brick 's autism cases and THM exposure , there was no smoking gun .\nIn fact , any way they cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the elevated THM rates in the local water supply and the local autism cases .\nIn short , ATSDR 's quest for a singular environmental toxin that might provide an easy explanation for Brick \u2019 s autism problem came up empty .\nSo despite autism rates in Brick that were far higher than anything ever seen before , CDC and ATSDR were unwilling to declare the Brick community an autism cluster .\nTo this day , autism rates in NJ are among the highest in the nation and among the highest reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey reported a rate of 1 in 93 children ) .\nBut in part because no obvious and easy toxin presented itself for blame and removal , the CDC took no position .\nAnd they pursued the issue no further .\nThe second question on the CDC 's plate was the question of the rising trend in autism rates .\nIn Gallagher 's support group meeting in 1997 , everyone had remarked on the unusually large numbers of 3-4 year old cases .\nAnd by January of 1999 , the CDC had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth years of their affected population .\nTheir conclusion on trend ?\nIn a classic bit of statistical doublespeak , they declared that there was no support for higher autism rates in younger children .\n`` Age-specific rates were calculated for preschool ( 3- to 5-year-old ) and school-aged ( 6- to 10-year-old ) children ... CIs [ confidence intervals ] for the 2 age groups overlapped , indicating that the prevalence rates for the 2 age-groups were not different . ''\nBut how could this be true ?\nIt seemed to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents and professionals on the ground , not to mention the hints that the CDC had been hearing for years about rising autism rates all over the country .\nUnlike the search for environmental toxins in the water , there was nothing all that complicated about the trend .\nEither there were more cases or there were n't .\nAnd if the rates were rising , however hard it might be to pin down the cause , it was important to keep looking , because too many children were sick .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of us at SafeMinds that the CDC 's conclusion in their Brick Township report was likely to be flawed .\nNot only was the rising trend apparent in their data , there were also a number of odd elements in their design and write up .\nFor one thing , the age groupings were strange\u2014separating the sample into two groups of unequal size , 3-5 and 6-10 year olds .\nWhy would they not divide the population into equal sizes , putting 3-6 year olds and 7-10 year olds together ?\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining Lisa Croen 's claims of diagnostic substitution in California , autism time trends can be easily misinterpreted if the analysts do n't factor in the lag time that the youngest children face in getting recognized ( the technical term is `` ascertainment bias '' ) .\nWhat if the Brick team , as most survey teams had done before them , had simply undercounted three year olds ?\nSo Sallie Bernard sent an email to Frank DeStefano of the CDC , whom she had met at a recent meeting .\nShe asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates with 3 year olds removed .\nAnd he responded in a May 10 , 2002 email , `` For overall ASD , the prevaleces ( sic ) were : 10.2 per 1,000 among children 4-6 years old , 4.4 per 1,000 among those 7-10 years old . ''\nSallie promptly thanked him and , noticing that this rate differential seemed larger than the published study , asked him if these were statistically significant .\nDeStefano 's response was telling .\n`` The results are based on 35 cases out of an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 19 cases out of an estimated 4272 children 7-10 years of age .\nThe difference in prevalences noted below is statistically significant . ''\n[ emphasis added ] In other words the published conclusion changed completely if you simply removed a single age group , the three year olds .\nDespite providing a stunning admission , DeStefano had still not given us what we really wanted , which was the breakdown by age category .\nSo Sallie asked him again .\nAnd a few months later , she received this response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy New Year !\nFrank Destefano has asked me to respond to your question about rates of autistic disorder for Brick Township .\nThey are : ( per 1000 ) , rounded This was even more of a shocker .\nWhat Yeargin-Allsopp had revealed was that there was not a single case of full syndrome autism in the entire Brick Township population of nine and ten year olds .\nThis was a different case definition than the one DeStefano had given us , which included PDD NOS and Asperger 's cases .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental concern over the unusual number of cases in the younger children .\nAnd here it was in black and white -- the CDC had this data all along .\nSo on the second crucial part of their charge , the evidence was clear .\nThe CDC knew there was an autism epidemic in Brick Township in 1998 .\nAnd they neither said nor did anything about it .\nIn fact , they did exactly the opposite : they used a clever bit of statistical trickery to cover it up .\nHow clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real trend data , you can figure out how hard the CDC had to work in order to report a result that said there was no trend .\nAnd in the months between January 1999 and April of 2000 , the CDC figured out just about the only possible way to claim that autism rates were n't rising .\nThey took the 6-10 year group , one where autism rates rose from just plain zero to 1 in 143 and put them into one bucket .\nThey took the 3-5 year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a declining rate ( from 1 in 128 to 1 in 394 ) and put them into another bucket .\nAnd they compared these two ratios and reported that there was no significance to the rising trend .\nAnd if you run the statistics on just this arrangement of the data , they are correct .\nBut the problem with this approach is that it 's too clever by half .\nVirtually every other reasonable grouping shows a significant increase .\n\u2022 DeStefano 's analysis comparing ASD rates in 4-6 year olds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase with a 99 % confidence level ( statistical `` significance '' kicks in at 95 % confidence ) .\n\u2022 If you take the full syndrome autism group and divide it into two equally sized buckets , comparing 3-6 year olds and 7-10 year olds , you also get a significant result with 99 % confidence .\n\u2022 If you take the 5-6 year old group of full syndrome kids and compare it to the 9-10 year old kids , you get an even more significant finding , more than 99.9 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are lies , damned lie and statistics .\nIf this was n't a cover up , I do n't know what else to call it .\nFor some , myself included , a picture is worth a thousand words .\nAnd if the problem in Brick was indeed more than a cluster , if there was a broader national trend towards rising autism rates , then what matters is not just the age of the Brick children , but their birth years .\nA more consistent national trend would be revealed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates in the same birth years .\nAnd a clear picture of the increasing trend would help us identify the kinds of environmental causes that were n't just local elevated toxins in the Brick water supply .\nThe Brick study provided the first data that could paint this picture and show the specific turning point in autism rates .\nThe age groupings in the Brick team 's study were based on the `` attained age in 1998 '' , so the ages are easily converted to birth years .\nEvery child who attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in 1995 , the four year olds were born in 1996 and so on , up to the ten year olds , who were born in 1988 .\nThe chart below shows the data Yeargin-Allsopp sent to Sallie Bernard and compares it to the data the CDC published .\nAs you can see , the rates exploded in the 1990-94 birth years and then dropped off a bit in the 3 year olds , due to the ascertainment effect .\nLooking at the numbers year by year ( the dotted line ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates ( the flat solid line ) , it 's easy to see just how deceptive the CDC 's reported findings truly were .\nAs I said in part 1 , there is a moment of truth in the life of any institution .\nAnd here was the moment for the CDC , the crucial point `` when they proceeded from uncertainty , to confusion , to ( perhaps if we 're charitable ) error and then to a policy commitment.\n\u201d In this case , attributing the stage after confusion to error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFaced with the evidence pointing to the worst childhood epidemic in modern memory , the CDC chose to cover it up .\nWhen you have the real data , the numbers literally jumped off the page .\nBut the only published finding was `` no trend '' , the only commentary , bland reassurance .\nWhat kind of pressure would make professional people do something like this ?\nAfter such a diligent and responsive start , such a spirit of openness and candor , what moved the CDC team to put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nIt 's worth remembering what was happening in the period between January 1999 and April 2000 .\nMost of Washington DC was consumed with the impeachment proceedings ending in Clinton 's acquittal on February 12 , 1999 .\nIn March 1999 , just two months after the CDC press conference , the California Department of Developmental Services issued their own report showing the sharp increases of autism rates in California .\nA few months after that , in July 1999 , the Public Health Service announced its plans to remove thimerosal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed their work , it 's almost certain that the public posture the CDC would take in the Brick report took on added importance .\nAfter all , as the chart shows , the real surge in Brick was in line with the expansion in the required immunization program , certainly correlated with thimerosal exposure .\nSo there 's little doubt that the CDC was worried about its own role in provoking an autism epidemic .\nAt the same time , as the durable evidence of elevated rates in New Jersey have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of something more specific to the Brick environment .\nSpeculation aside , however , this was a moment of choice .\nAnd in a moment that required continued professionalism , openness and candor , something else happened .\nIt was pretty pathetic .\nIn April 2000 , after many months of silence Bobbie Gallagher got a call from the CDC .\nThey were coming to town to release their study , both the CDC prevalence report and the ATSDR analysis of local toxins .\nThey came to her house , gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond in the moment if she had any questions .\nThey confessed that the autism rates in Brick were three times higher than rates they were seeing elsewhere .\nBut they had no plans to do anything more about it .\nThen they left the Gallagher 's ' house to go to the public meeting , where they took the same basic approach .\nThey made no presentations , simply put the two reports on the table and made themselves available for questions .\nThey had two sessions , one for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front of the room , Gallagher reports that there were two groups of people .\nOne was the familiar team , Bove , Mars , Bertrand , who had done the work and been part of the initial outreach .\nNext to them was another group `` we had never seen before .

corporations pale in comparison in view of the extent of the damage that the corona crisis has caused and continues to cause .\nThis corona crisis , according to all we know today , must be renamed a corona scandal ; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages .\nOn a political level , everything must be done to make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with their corrupt agendas .\nAnd , for this reason , I will now explain to you how and where an international network of lawyers will argue this biggest tort case ever - the corona fraud scandal - which has meanwhile unfolded into probably the greatest crime against humanity ever committed .\nCrimes against humanity were first defined in connection with the Nuremberg trials after World War II , that is when they dealt with the main war criminals of the Third Reich .\nCrimes against humanity are today regulated in section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello .\nI am Reiner Fuellmich and I have been admitted to the bar in Germany and in California for 26 years .\nI have been practicing law primarily as a trial lawyer against fraudulent corporations such as Deutsche bank , formerly one of the world 's largest and most respected banks , today one of the most toxic criminal organisations in the world ; VW , one of the world 's largest and most respected car manufacturers , today notorious for its giant diesel fraud ; and Cunard and Niagara the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suing them in a multi-million-dollar bribery case .\nI 'm also one of four members of the German Corona Investigative Committee .\nSince July 10 , 2020 , this committee has been listening to a large number of international scientists and experts ' testimony - to find answers to questions about the corona crisis which more and more people worldwide are asking .\nBelow is an unofficial transcript of Reiner Fuellmich 's Crimes Against Humanity speech .\nPlease excuse any errors regarding the German .\nThank you to JF in the UK for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three major questions to be answered in the context of a judicial approach to the corona scandal are:1 .\nIs there a corona pandemic or is there only a Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) test pandemic , specifically does a positive PCR test result mean that the person tested is infected with COVID-19 , or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the COVID-19 infection ?\n2 .\nDo the so-called anti-corona measures such as the lockdown , mandatory face masks , social distancing and quarantine regulations serve to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do these measures serve only to make people panic - so that they believe without asking any questions that their lives are in danger , so that in the end the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests , antigen and antibody tests and vaccines , as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints ?\n3 .\nIs it true that the German government was massively lobbied more , so than any other country , by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of the Institute at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin ; Mr Lothar Wieler , veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC , the RKI ; and Mr Tedros Adhanom , head of the World Health Organisation or WHO ,

measures ?\nAnswers to these three questions are urgently needed because the allegedly new and highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality anywhere in the world and certainly not here in Germany ; but the anti-corona measures whose only basis are the PCR test results ( which are in turn all based on the German Drosten test ) have in the meantime caused the loss of innumerable human lives , and have destroyed the economic existence of countless companies and individuals worldwide.In Australia , for example , people are thrown into prison if they do not wear a mask or do not wear it properly as deemed by the authorities .\nIn the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask , or do not wear it properly in this sense , are getting shot in the head.Let me first give you a summary of the facts that they present , as they present themselves .\nToday the most important thing in a lawsuit is to establish the facts ; that is , to find out what actually happened .\nThis is because the application of the law always depends on the facts at issue .\nIf I want to prosecute someone for fraud , I can not do that by presenting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what happened here regarding the alleged corona pandemic ?\nThe facts laid out below are to a large extent the result of the work of the corona investigative committee .\nThis committee was founded on July 10th by four lawyers in order to determine through hearing expert testimony of international scientists and other experts : How dangerous is the virus really ?\nWhat is the significance of a post-positive PCR test ?\nWhat collateral damage has been caused by the corona measures both with respect to the world 's population 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's economy ?\nLet me start with a little bit of background information : what happened in May 2019 and then in early 2020 , and what happened 12 years earlier with the swine flu , which many of you may have forgotten about .\nIn May of 2019 , the stronger of the two parties which govern Germany in a grand coalition , the CDU , held a congress on global health , apparently at the instigation of important players from the pharmaceutical industry and in the tech industry .\nAt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ) gave their speeches .\nAngela Merkel was there and the German secretary of health , Jens Spahn , but some other people whom one would not necessarily expect to be present at such a gathering were also there .\nProfessor Drosten , virologist , from the Charite hospital in Berlin ; Professor Wieler , veterinarian , and head of the RKI ( the German equivalent of the CDC ) as well as Mr Tadros Adhanom , philosopher , and head of the world health organisation ( WHO ) .\nThey all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving speeches were the chief lobbyists of the world 's two largest health funds , namely , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Welcome Trust .\nLess than a year later these very people called the shots in the proclamation of the worldwide corona pandemic , made sure that mass PCR tests were used to prove mass infections with COVID-19 all over the world , and are now pushing for vaccines to be invented and sold worldwide .\nThese infections , or rather the positive test results that the PCR tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for worldwide lockdowns , social distancing and mandatory face masks .\nIt is important to note at this point that the definition of a pandemic was changed 12 years earlier .\nUntil then , a pandemic was considered to be a disease that spread worldwide and which led to many serious illnesses and deaths .\nSuddenly , and for reasons never explained , it was supposed to be a worldwide disease , only , many serious illnesses and many deaths were not required anymore , to announce a pandemic .\nDue to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intertwined with the global pharmaceutical industry , was able to declare the swine flu pandemic in 2009 , with the result that vaccines were produced and sold worldwide , on the basis of contracts that have been kept secret until today .\nThese vaccines proved to be completely unnecessary because the swine flu eventually turned out to be a mild flu and never became the horrific plague that the pharmaceutical industry and its affiliated universities kept announcing it would turn into , with millions of deaths certain to happen , if people did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to serious health problems : about 700 children in Europe fell incurably ill with narcolepsy and are now forever severely disabled .\nThe vaccines bought with millions of taxpayers ' money had to be destroyed , with even more taxpayers ' money .\nAlready then , during the swine flu , the German virologist Drosten was one of those who stirred up panic in the population ; repeating over and over again that the swine flu would claim many hundreds of thousands , even millions of deaths , all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly thanks to Dr Wolfgang Wodarg and his efforts as a member of the German Bundestag and also a member of the Council of Europe , that this hoax was brought to an end , before it would lead to even more serious consequences .\nFast forward to March of 2020 , when the German Bundestag announced an epidemic situation of national importance which is the German equivalent of a pandemic , in March of 2020 , and based on this , the lockdown - with the suspension of all essential constitutional rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one single opinion on which the federal government in Germany based its ' decision .\nIn an outrageous violation of the universally accepted principle audiator at ultra parse , which means that one must also hear the other side .\nThe only person they listened to was Mr Drosten , that is , the very person whose horrific panic-inducing prognosis had proved to be catastrophically false 12 years earlier .\nWe know this because a whistle-blower named David Siva , a member of the green party , told us about it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 in Berlin in the context of an event at which Robert F Kennedy Junior also took part , and at which both men gave speeches ; and he did so afterwards in one of the sessions of our corona committee .\nThe reason he did this is that he had become increasingly sceptical about the official narrative propagated by politicians and the mainstream media .\nHe had therefore undertaken an effort to find out about other scientists ' opinions and had found them on the internet .\nThere he realised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists who held a completely different opinion which contradicted the horrific prognosis of Mr Drosten .\nThey assumed , and still do assume , that there was no disease that went beyond the gravity of the seasonal flu ; that the population had already acquired cross or T-cell immunity against this allegedly new virus ; and that there was therefore no reason for any special measures and certainly not for vaccinations .\nThese scientists include Professor John Ioannidis of Stanford University in California , a specialist in statistics and epidemiology as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the most quoted scientists in the world ; Professor Michael Levitt , Nobel prize winner for chemistry , and also a biophysicist at Stanford University , the German Professors Karin Mulling , Sucharit Bhakdi , Klud Wittkowski as well as Stefan Homburg and now many , many , more scientists and doctors worldwide ; including Dr Mike Yeadon .\nDr Mike Yeadon is the former vice president and scientific director of Pfizer , one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world .\nI will talk some more about him a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning of April , of 2020 Mr Sieber turned to the leadership of his green party with the knowledge he had accumulated and suggested that they present these other scientific opinions to the public and explain that contrary to Mr Drosten 's doomsday prophecies there was no reason for the public to panic .\nIncidentally , Lord Sumption , who served as a judge at the British Supreme Court from 2012 to 2018 , had done the very same thing , at the very same time , it had come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no factual basis for panic and no legal basis for the corona measures .\nLikewise , the former President of the German Federal Constitutional Court expressed , albeit more cautiously , serious doubts that the corona measures were constitutional .\nBut instead of taking note of these other opinions and discussing them with David Sieber , the green party leadership declared that Mr Drosten 's panic messages were good enough for the German party .\nFor the green party , remember , they 're not a member of the ruling coalition ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for them , just as it had been good enough for the federal government as a basis for its lockdown decision , they said .\nSubsequently , the green party leadership called David Sieber a conspiracy theorist , without ever having considered the content of his information and then stripped him of his mandates .\nNow , let 's take a look at the current , actual situation regarding the virus 's danger ; the complete uselessness of PCR tests for the detection of infections ; and the lockdowns based on non-existent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the health care systems were never in danger of becoming overwhelmed by COVID-19 .\nOn the contrary , many hospitals remain empty to this day and some are now facing bankruptcy .\nThe hospital ship Comfort which anchored in New York at the time , and could have accommodated a thousand patients , never accommodated more than some 20 patients .\nNowhere was there any excess mortality .\nStudies carried out by Professor Ioannidis and others have shown that the mortality of corona is equivalent to that of the seasonal flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York that were used to demonstrate to the world that panic was in order proved to be deliberately misleading .\nThen , the so-called \u2018 panic paper \u2019 was leaked which was written by the German Department of the Interior .\nIts classified content shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that in fact the population was deliberately driven to panic by politicians and mainstream media .\nThe accompanying irresponsible statements of the head of the RKI , remember the CDC , Mr Wieler who repeatedly and excitedly announced that the corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , without them asking any question shows that he followed the script verbatim .\nIn his public statements he kept announcing that the situation was very grave and threatening although the figures compiled by his own institute proved the exact opposite .\nAmong other things , the panic paper calls for children to be made to feel responsible and , I quote , for the painful tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow the corona rules ; that is , if they do not wash their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandparents .\nA word of clarification : in Bergamo , the vast majority of deaths , 94 percent to be exact , turned out to be the result , not of COVID-19 , but rather the consequence of the government deciding to transfer sick patients , sick with probably the cold or seasonal flu , from hospitals to nursing homes - in order to make room at the hospitals for all the COVID-19 patients , who ultimately never arrived .\nThere at the nursing homes , they then infected old people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of pre-existing medical conditions , in addition , a flu vaccination which had previously been administered had further weakened the immune systems of the people in the nursing homes .\nIn New York only some , but by far not all , hospitals were overwhelmed .\nMany people , most of whom were again elderly and had serious pre-existing medical conditions and most of whom had it not been for the panic mongering would have just stayed at home to recover , raced to the hospitals .\nThere many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nosocomial infections on the one hand and incidents of malpractice on the other hand , for example : by being put on a respirator rather than receiving oxygen through an oxygen mask .\nAgain to clarify , COVID-19 , this is the current state of affairs , is a dangerous disease , just like the seasonal flu is a dangerous disease and of course COVID-19 , just like the seasonal flu may sometimes take a severe clinical course and will sometimes kill patients .\nHowever , as autopsies have shown , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular by the forensic scientist Professor Klaus P\u00fcschel , in Hamburg , the fatalities he examined had almost all been caused by serious pre-existing conditions and almost all of the people who had died , had died at a very old age , just like in Italy , meaning they had lived beyond their average life expectancy .\nIn this context the following should also be mentioned : the German RKI , that is again the equivalent of the CDC , had initially , strangely enough , recommended that no autopsies be performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and hospitals worldwide had been paid money for declaring a deceased person a victim of COVID-19 rather than writing down the true cause of death on the death certificate , for example a heart attack or a gunshot wound .\nWithout the autopsies we would never know that the overwhelming majority of the alleged COVID-19 victims had died of completely different diseases but not of COVID-19 .\nThe assertion that the lockdown was necessary because there were so many different infections with SARS-CoV-2 and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have learned from the hearings we conducted with the Corona Committee and from other data that has become available in the meantime .\n\u2022 a ) the lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating .\nBy the time the lockdown was imposed the alleged infection rates were already dropping again .\n\u2022 b ) There 's already protection from the virus because of cross or t-cell immunity , apart from the above mentioned lockdown being imposed , when the infection rates were already dropping there is also cross or t-cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronaviruses contained in every flu or influenza wave .\nThis is true , even if this time around a slightly different strain of the coronavirus was at work , and that is because the body 's own immune system remembers every virus it has ever battled in the past , and from this experience it also recognises a supposedly new but still similar strain of the virus from the corona family .\nIncidentally that 's how the PCR test for the detection of an infection was invented by the now infamous Professor Drosten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , based on this very basic knowledge , Mr Drosten developed his PCR test which supposedly detects an infection with SARS-CoV-2 .\nWithout ever having seen the real Wuhan virus from China , only having learned from social media reports that there was something going on in Wuhan , he started tinkering on his computer with what would become his corona PCR test .\nFor this he used an old SARS [ severe respiratory syndrome ] virus hoping it would be sufficiently similar to the allegedly new strain of the coronavirus found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of his computer tinkering to China to determine whether the victims of the alleged new coronavirus tested positive .\nThey did , and that was enough for the WHO to sound the pandemic alarm and to recommend the worldwide use of the Drosten PCR test for the detection of infections with the virus now called SARS-CoV-2 .\nDrosten 's opinion and advice was , this must be emphasised , once again the only source for the German Government when it announced the lockdown , as well as the rules for social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this must also be emphasised once again , Germany apparently became the centre of , especially , massive lobbying by the pharmaceutical and tech .\nindustry because the world , was referenced to the allegedly disciplined Germans , should do as the Germans do in order to survive the pandemic .\n\u2022 c ) and this is the most important part of our fact-finding .\nThe PCR test is being used on the basis of false statements , not based on scientific facts with respect to infections .\nIn the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contrary to the assertions of Messrs. Drosten , Wieler and the WHO , do not give any indication of an infection with any virus let alone an infection with SARS-CoV-2 .\nNote : not only are PCR tests expressly not approved for diagnostic purposes , as is correctly noted on leaflets coming with these tests , and as the inventor of the PCR test , Kary Mullis , has repeatedly emphasised .\nInstead they 're simply incapable of diagnosing any disease .\nThat is , contrary to the assertions of Drosten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been making since the proclamation of the pandemic , a positive PCR test result does not mean that an infection is present .\nIf someone tests positive , it does not mean that they 're infected with anything let alone with the contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nEven the United States CDC , even this institution , agrees with this and I quote directly from page 38 of one of its publications on the coronavirus and the PCR tests dated July 13 2020 .\nFirst bullet point says : detection of viral RNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus or that 2019 nCoV [ novel coronavirus ] is the causative agent for clinical symptoms Second bullet point says : the performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of two threat 2019 nCoV infection Third bullet point says : this test can not rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens It is still not clear whether there has ever been a scientifically correct isolation of the Wuhan virus so that nobody knows exactly what we 're looking for when we test ; especially , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses mutates quickly .\nThe PCR swabs take one or two sequences of a molecule that are invisible to the human eye and therefore need to be amplified in many cycles to make it visible .\nEverything over 35 cycles is , as reported by the New York Times and others , considered completely unreliable and scientifically unjustifiable .\nHowever , the Drosten test as well as the WHO recommended tests that followed his example are set to 45 cycles .\nCan that be because of the desire to produce as many positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for the false assumption that a large number of infections have been detected ?\nThe test can not distinguish inactive and reproductive matter : that means that a positive result may happen because the test detects , for example , a piece of debris , a fragment of a molecule , which may signal nothing else more than the immune system of the person tested won a battle with a common cold in the past .\nEven Drosten himself declared in an interview with a German business magazine in 2014 , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infection with the MERS virus allegedly with the help of the PCR test , that these PCR tests are so highly sensitive that even very healthy and non-infectious people may test positive .\nAt that time , he also became very much aware of the powerful role of a panic and fear-mongering media , as you 'll see at the end of the following quote , he said then in this interview : \u201c If for example such a pathogen scurries over the nasal mucosa of a nurse for a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing anything , then she 's suddenly a MERS case.\n\u201d This could also explain the explosion of case numbers in Saudi Arabia .\nIn addition , the media there have made this into an incredible sensation .\nHas he forgotten this or is he deliberately concealing this in the corona context because corona is a very lucrative business opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole , and for Mr Alford Lund , his co-author in many studies , and also a PCR test producer .\nIn my view , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he knew about the PCR tests and told the business magazine in 2014 .\nIn short this test can not detect any infection , contrary to all false claims stating that it can , an infection , a so-called hot infection requires that the virus or rather a fragment of a molecule which may be a virus is not just found somewhere , for example , in the throat of a person without causing any damage that would be a cold infection , rather a hot infection requires that the virus penetrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes symptoms such as headaches or a sore throat .\nOnly then is a person really infected ; in the sense of a hot infection ; because only then is a person contagious , that is able to infect others , until then it is completely harmless for both the host and all other people that the host comes into contact with .\nOnce again , this means that positive test results , contrary to all other claims by Drosten , Wieler or the WHO mean nothing , with respect to infections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above .\nMeanwhile , a number of highly respected scientists worldwide assume that there has never been a corona pandemic but only a PCR test pandemic .\nThis is the conclusion reached by many German scientists such as Professors Bhakdi , Rice , M\u00f6lling , Hockerts , Wallach and many others including the above mentioned Professor John Ioannidis and the Nobel laureate , Professor Michael Levitt , from Stanford University .\nThe most recent such opinion is that of the aforementioned Dr Mike Yeadon , a former vice president and chief science officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 16 years .\nHe and his co-authors , all well-known scientists , published a scientific paper in September of 2020 and he wrote a corresponding magazine article on September 20th 2020 .\nAmong other things , he and they state , and I quote : \u201c We 're basing our government policy , our economic policy and the policy of restricting fundamental rights presumably on completely wrong data and assumptions about the coronavirus .\nIf it were n't for the test results that are constantly reported in the media , the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened.\n\u201d Of course , there are some serious individual cases of illness but there are also some in every flu epidemic .\nThere was a real wave of disease in March and April but since then everything has gone back to normal .\nOnly the positive results rise and sink wildly again and again , depending on how many tests are carried out , but the real cases of illnesses are over .\nThere can be no talk of a second wave .\nThe allegedly new strain of the coronavirus is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a new type of the long known coronavirus ; there are at least four coronaviruses that are endemic and cause some of the common colds we experience , especially in winter .\nThey all have a striking sequence similarity to the coronavirus and because the human immune system recognises the similarity to the virus that has now , allegedly , been newly discovered , a t-cell immunity has long existed in this respect , 30 percent of the population had this before the , allegedly , new virus even appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called herd immunity that 15 to 25 percent of the population are infected with the allegedly new coronavirus to stop the further spread of the virus , and this has long been the case .\nRegarding the all-important PCR tests , Yeadon writes in a piece called : \u2018 Lies , Damned Lies and Health Statistics - the Deadly Danger of False Positives \u2019 , dated September 20th 2020 and I quote : \u2018 \u2026The likelihood of an apparently positive case being a false positive is between 89 to 94 percent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agreement with the professors of immunology , Camera from Germany , Capel from the Netherlands and Cahill from Ireland as well as a microbiologist , Dr Harvey from Austria , all of whom testified before the German corona committee , explicitly points out that a positive test does not mean that an intact virus has been found .\nThe authors explain that what the PCR test actually measures is , and I quote : `` Simply the presence of partial RNA sequences present in the intact virus which could be a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the subject sick , and can not be transmitted and can not make anyone else sick - because of the complete unsuitability of the test for the detection of infectious diseases - tested positive in goats , sheep , papayas and even chicken wings .\nOxford Professor Carl Heneghan , director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine writes that the COVID-19 virus would never disappear , if this test practice were to be continued , but would always be falsely detected , in much of what is tested .\nLockdowns as Yeadon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work .\nSweden with its laissez-faire approach and Great Britain with its strict lockdown , for example , have completely comparable disease and mortality statistics .\nThe same was found by US scientists concerning the different US states ; it makes no difference to the incidence of disease whether a state implements a lockdown or not .\nWith regard to the now infamous , Imperial College of London \u2019 s , Professor Neil Ferguson and his completely false computer model ; models warning of millions of deaths ; he [ Yeadon ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c No serious scientist gives any validity to Ferguson 's model.\n\u201d He points out , with thinly veiled contempt , again I quote : \u201c It 's important that you know most scientists do n't accept that it , that is Ferguson 's model , was even faintly right but the government is still wedded to the model.\n\u201d Ferguson predicted 40 000 corona deaths in Sweden by May and a hundred thousand by June but it remained at five thousand eight hundred which , according to the Swedish authorities , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PCR tests had not been used as a diagnostic tool for corona infections there would not be a pandemic and there would be no lockdowns but everything would have been perceived as just a medium or light wave of influenza these scientists conclude .\nDr Yeadon in his piece : \u2018 Lies , Damned Lies and Health Statistics - the Deadly Danger of False Positives \u2019 writes : \u201c This test is fatally flawed and must immediately be withdrawn and never used again in this setting , unless shown to be fixed.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ article : \u201c I have explained how a hopelessly performing diagnostic test has been , and continues to be used , not for diagnosis of disease but it seems solely to create fear.\n\u201d Now , let 's take a look at the current actual situation regarding the severe damage caused by the lockdowns and other measures .\nAnother detailed paper written by a German official in the Department of the Interior , who is responsible for risk assessment and the protection of the population against risks , was leaked recently .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis paper comes to the conclusion that there was , and is , no sufficient evidence for serious health risks for the population , as claimed by Drosten , Wieler , and the WHO .\nBut the author says there 's very much evidence of the corona measures causing gigantic health and economic damage to the population which he then describes in detail in this paper .\nThis he concludes will lead to very high claims for damages , which the government will be held responsible for .\nThis has now become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended .\nMore and more scientists but also lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic , democracy is in great danger of being replaced by fascist totalitarian models .\nAs I already mentioned above , in Australia people who do not wear the masks , which more and more studies show are hazardous to health , or who allegedly do not wear them correctly , are arrested , handcuffed and thrown into jail .\nIn the Philippines they run the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other previously , civilised countries , children are taken away from their parents if they do not comply with quarantine regulations , distance regulations and mask wearing -regulations .\nAccording to psychologists and psychotherapists who testified before the corona committee , children are traumatised en masse , with the worst psychological consequences yet to be expected in the medium and long term .\nIn Germany alone , 500 000 to 800 000 bankruptcies are expected in the fall to strike small and medium-sized businesses which form the backbone of the economy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incalculably high and long-term social security money transfers for among other things unemployment benefits .\nSince in the meantime , pretty much everybody is beginning to understand the full devastating impact of the completely unfounded corona measures , I will refrain from detailing this any further .\nLet me now give you a summary of the legal consequences ; the most difficult part of a lawyer 's work is always to establish the true facts .\nNot the application of the legal rules to these facts .\nUnfortunately , a German lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his Anglo-American counterparts do get the necessary training for this , at their law schools , and probably for this reason , but also because of the much more pronounced independence of the American , Anglo-American judiciary , the Anglo-American law of evidence is much more effective in practice than the German one .\nA court of law can only decide a legal dispute correctly if it has previously determined the facts correctly , which is not possible without looking at all the evidence and that 's why the law of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facts summarised above , in particular , those established with the help of the work of the German corona committee , the legal evaluation is actually simple .\nIt is simple for all civilised legal systems regardless of whether these legal systems are based on civil law , which follows the Roman law more closely , or whether they are based on Anglo-American common law which is only loosely connected to Roman law .\nLet 's first take a look at the unconstitutionality of the measures ; a number of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Youngblood and Foskarau have stated either in written expert opinions or in interviews in line with the serious doubts expressed by the former president of the federal constitutional court with respect to the constitutionality of the corona measures , that these measures , the corona measures , are without a sufficient factual basis and also without a sufficient legal basis and are therefore unconstitutional and must be repealed immediately .\nVery recently , a judge , Torsten Schleife is his name , declared publicly that the German judiciary , just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no longer able to administer justice properly .\nHe says that the courts of law , and I quote : \u201c Have all too quickly waved through coercive measures which for millions of people all over Germany represent massive suspensions of their constitutional rights.\n\u201d He points out that German citizens , again I quote : \u201c Are currently experiencing the most serious encroachment on their constitutional rights since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 .\nIn order to contain the corona pandemic federal and state governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in part threatening the very existence of the country , as it is guaranteed by the constitutional rights of the people .\nWhat about fraud , intentional infliction of damage and crimes against humanity ?\nBased on the rules of criminal law asserting false facts concerning the PCR tests or intentional risk misrepresentation , as it was committed by Messrs Drosten and Wieler as well as the WHO , can only be assessed as fraud .\nBased on the rules of civil tort law , this translates into intentional infliction of damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin Schwab , supports this finding in public interviews in a comprehensive legal opinion of around 180 pages .\nHe has familiarised himself with the subject matter like no other legal scholar has done thus far and in particular has provided a detailed account of the complete failure of the mainstream media to report on the true facts of this so-called pandemic .\nMessrs Drosten , Wieler and Tedros of the WHO all knew , based on their own expertise , or the expertise of their institutions , that the PCR tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but asserted over and over again to the general public that they can ; with their counterparts all over the world repeating this .\nAnd they all knew , and accepted , that on the basis of their recommendations the governments of the world would decide on lockdowns , the rules for social distancing and mandatory wearing of masks .\nThe latter , representing a very serious health hazard as more and more independent studies and expert statements show .\nUnder the rules of civil tort law , all those who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests induced lockdowns are entitled to receive full compensation for their losses .\nIn particular , there is a duty to compensate , that is , a duty to pay damages , for the loss of profits suffered by companies and self-employed persons as a result of the lockdown , and other measures .\nIn the meantime , however , the anti-corona measures have caused and continue to cause such devastating damage to the world 's population 's health and economy that the crimes committed by Messrs Drosten , Wieler and the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against humanity , as defined in Section 7 of the International Criminal Code .\nHow can we do something ?\nWhat can we do ?\nWell , the class action is the best route to compensatory damages and to political consequences .\nThe so-called class action lawsuit is based on English law and exists today in the USA and in Canada .\nIt enables a court of law to allow complaint for damages to be tried as a class action lawsuit at the request of a plaintiff , if : as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people , suffer the same type of damage Phrased differently , a judge can allow a class-action lawsuit to go forward if common questions of law and fact make up the vital component of the lawsuit .\nHere , the common questions of law in fact revolve around the worldwide PCR test based lockdowns and its consequences ; just like the VW diesel passenger cars were functioning products but they were defective due to a so-called defeat device because they did n't comply with the emissions standards , so too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good products in other settings , are defective products when it comes to the diagnosis of infections .\nNow if an American or Canadian company or an American or Canadian individual decides to sue these persons in the United States or Canada for damages , then the court called upon to resolve this dispute may , upon request , allow this complaint to be tried as a class action lawsuit .\nIf this happens all affected parties worldwide will be informed about this through publications in the mainstream media and will thus have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a certain period of time to be determined by the court .\nIt should be emphasised that nobody must join the class action , but every injured party can join the class action .\nThe advantage of the class action is that only one trial is needed , namely , to try the complaint of a representative plaintiff who is affected in a manner typical of everyone else in the class .\nThis is firstly cheaper , and secondly faster , than hundreds of thousands or more individual lawsuits and thirdly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , fourthly as a rule , it allows a much more precise examination of the accusations than would be possible in the context of hundreds of thousands or , more likely in this corona setting , even millions of individual lawsuits .\nIn particular , the well-established and proven Anglo-American law of evidence , with its pre-trial discovery , is applicable .\nThis requires that all evidence relevant for the determination of the lawsuit is put on the table .\nIn contrast to the typical situation in German lawsuits with structural imbalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand a consumer and on the other hand a powerful corporation ; the withholding or even destruction of evidence is not without consequence , rather the party withholding or even destroying evidence loses the case under these evidence rules .\nHere in Germany , a group of tort lawyers have banded together to help their clients with recovery of damages .\nThey have provided all relevant information and forms for German plaintiffs to both estimate how much damage they have suffered and join the group or class of plaintiffs who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes forward either in Canada or the US .\nInitially , this group of lawyers had considered to also collect and manage the claims for damages of other non-German plaintiffs but this proved to be unmanageable .\nHowever , through an international lawyers \u2019 network , which is growing larger by the day , the German group of attorneys provides to all of their colleagues , in all other countries , free of charge , all relevant information , including expert opinions and testimonies of experts showing that the PCR tests can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all relevant information as to how they can prepare and bundle the claims for damages of their clients so that they too can assert their clients claims for damages either in their home countries , courts of law , or within the framework of the class action as explained above .\nThese scandalous corona facts gathered mostly by the corona committee and summarised above are the very same facts that will soon be proven to be true , either in one court of law or in many courts of law , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts that will pull the masks off the faces of all those responsible for these crimes .\nTo the politicians , who believe those corrupt people , these facts are hereby offered as a lifeline , that can help you readjust your course of action and start the long overdue public scientific discussion and not go down with those charlatans and criminals .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/zr9jCrGF7HE/reiner-fuellmich-crimes-against-humanity-transcript.html", "published": "2020-10-07T06:01:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1602064860, "collection_utc": 1602070292}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-10-07--Quarentism", "date": "2020-10-07", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Quarentism", "content": "I saw this meme on social media yesterday .\nIt made me think of `` Molly Brown '' , socialite @ @ @ @ @ wh o is said to have tried to convince her lifeboat crew to go back @ @ @ @ @ for survivors .\nThey refused .\nThere was a play and movie made about her @ @ @ @ @ Brown '' that fictionalized her life .\nIf we were aboard the Titanic , we @ @ @ @ @ the ship from Captain to cook to bottle washer .\nTo musician .\nTo maid @ @ @ @ @ navigator .\nTo star reader .\nTo alarm blower .\nTo water baler .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ in the frigid waters to protect others .\nBut we 're treated as cold as @ @ @", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/efeRsBA165E/quarentism.html", "published": "2020-10-07T06:00:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1602064800, "collection_utc": 1602070293}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-10-07--The VP Debate 2020", "date": "2020-10-07", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "The VP Debate 2020", "content": "It \u2019 s just hours before the VP debate .\nAutism has been absent from any election dialog as far @ @ @ @ @ there be any mention ?", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/TfWjdyI9r7A/the-vp-debate-2020.html", "published": "2020-10-07T16:41:50-04:00", "published_utc": 1602103310, "collection_utc": 1602117086}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-10-08--1986 The Act: See the Movie Scarier than Halloween Itself For Yourself", "date": "2020-10-08", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "1986 The Act: See the Movie Scarier than Halloween Itself For Yourself", "content": "We are happy to share this great news from Andy Wakefield and his crew : DVD PRE-SALE UPDATE We are @ @ @ @ @ DVDs finished manufacturing TODAY !\nThis week they will be on the road to us @ @ @ @ @ to everyone who purchased a pre-sale DVD .\nDVDs & merch will be available internationally @ @", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/oiC94i324ZA/1986-the-act-see-the-movie-scarier-than-halloween-itself-for-yourself.html", "published": "2020-10-08T06:00:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1602151200, "collection_utc": 1602156714}, {"id": "ageofautism--2020-10-08--\"Triumph\" and \"Ambush\" vaccines to be rolled out in the UK next month?", "date": "2020-10-08", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "\"Triumph\" and \"Ambush\" vaccines to be rolled out in the UK next month?", "content": "\u201c Mass vaccination sites and mobile facilities are being commissioned as part of as a `` fairly massive exercise '' ...\nAccording to the document , the two vaccines are called Ambush and Triumph ...

Handler had done his own research and he understood the dangers of an untested , unsafe , liability-free vaccine and how our basic liberties were being threatened .\nBy Anne Dachel Rabbi Hillel Handler from New York City is someone I first got to know in 2013 when he was speaking out against the forced vaccination of Orthodox Jewish children against measles .\n\u201c This is a man who made a regulation , an executive order , dictatorial executive order : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in people from the hospitals who are stricken with COVID 19 and bring them into a population of vulnerable people who are weak , who haven \u2019 t got strong immune systems .\nHe was warned by emails from the nursing home operators , you \u2019 re going to kill our people !\nDon \u2019 t do it.\n\u201d Rabbi Handler explained that Cuomo threaten to remove the licenses of nursing home operators .\n\u201c So under blackmail , they followed his orders and forty percent of the deaths in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died .\nNot died , they were murdered , intentionally.\n\u201d The rabbi pointed out the hypocrisy of New York Mayor De Blasio ordering lockdowns while promoting mobs of people involved in the Blacks Lives Matter movement .\n\u201c If the mayor really and truly believes that social distancing is important , masks are important , why did he address a Black Lives Matter rally in Brooklyn , over a thousand people , packed together like sardines , and the mayor lecturing to them without a mask .\nIf he really thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that ?\n\u2026 \u201c The answer is these politicians know that

COVID deaths , now , with fewer people dying , they talk about people testing positive .\nHe warned that people must stand together and not close down their schools , not surrender their rights .\nI asked Rabbi Handler about his comments on governments using fear and he said , \u201c That is how the corrupt CDC gets everyone to follow their insane and deadly vaccine mandates !\n\u201d His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear of a pandemic was a chilling reminder of what medical freedom advocate Robert Kennedy , Jr. said in Berlin in August .\nDuring his remarks at a press conference there on August 28 , 2020 , Robert Kennedy , Jr. said this about how tyrannical governments use their power and he also cited Goering \u2019 s words .\n\u201c For many years totalitarian or authoritarian states have used the power of fear to engineer compliance in populations .\nI grew up understanding what happened in World War II in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman Goering was asked by the prosecutor , how did you make the German people comply ?\nGoering said , it \u2019 s not just Germany , this works in any country , whether it \u2019 s a fascist country or a communist country or a monarchy or a democracy .\nAll the rulers need to do is to tell the people that there \u2019 s something they need to be fearful of .\nPoint a finger at that source of their fear and you can make human beings do anything you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaughter like sheep ; you can make them obey.\n\u201d He continued making an ominous observation about COVID 19 and government control .\nNow they have a source of fear that is the most pervasive , an all-encompassing power that they \u2019 ve ever had which is the fear of pandemic .\nGovernments love pandemics the same way that they love wars because it gives them power ; it gives them control and it gives them the capacity to impose obedience on human beings .\nToday we have an inflection of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose controls on populations that have never been imagined before in human history by any tyrant in history .\nWe all need to listen to these two outspoken critics of the government \u2019 s overreaching actions .\nHere in Wisconsin , like many places ,

force anyone to receive a COVID 19 vaccine when it becomes available since there is growing concern over vaccine safety .\nThe media is really saying is that while the federal government can \u2019 t

question what the government does you immediately [ are ] a conspiracy thinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to question what is going on , isn \u2019 t that to you very necessary because things are getting

.\nIn March and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German government , from the Ministry of Interior itself .\nThey said in those months ninety percent of all necessary operations , so surgery , have been not performed .\nSo people are suffering , and Germany is where 2.5 million people that suffered out of this .\n\u201c We see a lot of suicides out of this because of the things going on .\nWe see that the economy is breaking down , and it \u2019 s now time to ask the right questions .\n\u201c The right question is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done by facts , it \u2019 s done by interests .\nSo who has got the power to organize this in an orchestrated international way ?\nFirst .\n\u201c Second , CUI BONO , in Latin , who gets profit out of this ?\n\u201c These are the two right questions .\nThe medical well , system , the medical problem is not important.\n\u201d Hulleman : \u201c People are afraid of the medical problem.\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c Of course because they look at the television , they look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments .\nThey tell them this story , but the story is just not true .\nAnd then they \u2019 re coming back to responsibility , it \u2019 s us to give the punch.\n\u201d Hulleman : \u201c But also a lot of doctors believed their government .\nDid you believe your government at first ?\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c Not in this part because , well , I \u2019 m very into the

could follow this up \u201c We have this panic , orchestrated panic .\nWe had this in 2001 with anthrax , and it \u2019 s the same pattern .\n\u201c We need to step up and say , well , not a second time because we need to care about our people , our children.\n\u201d Hulleman : \u201c What will be next ?\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c Next will be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and that \u2019 s hard because we do not have the state media , we do not have the private media .\nJust to give an official number , 99.5 percent of all newspapers you are able to buy in a kiosk , in a shop in Germany , [ come ] from five private companies .\n99.5 percent , and these are official numbers from the first German television.\n\u201d Hulleman : \u201c What will be next for the doctors ?\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c Oh , next for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this great movement now , Doctors for the Truth .\nWe created as well an extra parliamentary inquiry committee on COVID 19 because the parliaments didn \u2019 t do this .\nSo we did it by ourselves , and we laid down all the facts , and now it \u2019 s time to get the movement .\n\u201c We had this great demonstration in Berlin .\nOn the first of

we will do this again in October , 2020 in Berlin .\n\u201c So again , Berlin invites Europe .\nCome to Berlin , demonstrate with us , and this time we will stay .\nSo let \u2019 s get your camping equipment with you .\nWe will stay there for long.\n\u201d Hulleman : \u201c And we will meet each other in Berlin , I believe , and I hope to invite you after that back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors who have seen that whatever is going on does not align with their conscience and their ethical , professional behavior.\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c And I need to thank you Sven , that you brought us all together here .\nSo I think it \u2019 s a good place here in the Netherlands to come together like we did today with the Belgians , with the French , with the doctors from the U.S. on zoom meeting and so on and so on .\nIt \u2019 s a good place here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Netherlands have played a very important role throughout history .\nThey have taken over the world , they have destroyed the world , but they have also been able to bind the world in a way .\n\u201c We hope to understand that the Netherlands can melt cultures and therefore understand all different European cultures and then find the consensus between the British , the French , the Germans , the Spanish , the Scandinavians , the Italians , because the Dutch , we honor national boundaries , but we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I believe that it is from those shared values that you and I try to find each other so that we can better help the people that seek our help.\n\u201d Schoning : \u201c We are one family of

; Italy ; Germany ; Poland ; Belgium ; Netherlands ; United Kingdom ; Ireland ; Sweden ; Denmark ; France ; and Austria .\nAnd we grow up hearing that , but people don \u2019 t really understand what it means , but it was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw what the Great Depression was doing in Eastern Europe , in Italy , in Germany and in Spain where that crisis was turning people towards fascism , in the eastern countries where the same crisis was turning people and governments towards communism and also causing the collapse of governments all over the world .\nAnd in our country , the United States , it \u2019 s hard for people to remember today that almost a third of the people in our country were completely disillusioned with capitalism and wanted to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to fascism .\nFranklin Roosevelt wanted to preserve our country for democracy , for free market capitalism , for civil rights and to preserve our Constitution .\nHe recognized that the weapon of authoritarian control was going to be fear .\nWhen I spoke a few weeks ago in Berlin , I reminded the people of Germany of a very famous story that happened during the Nuremberg Trials after World War II , when Hitler \u2019 s closest lieutenant and the head of the Luftwaffe , Herman Goring , was asked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get the German people\u2014the German people are the most educated people and were some of the most tolerant people in the world , the Weimar Republic was one of the strongest democracies in the world\u2014how did you take these people , who were so well educated and so awakened and so tolerant , and turn them into obedient slaves who committed some of the worst atrocities in human history ?\n\u201d Goering said , \u201c Oh , that \u2019 s a simple thing.\n\u201d And any of you can look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so .\nAnd he said : and it works not just in a fascist government , but it works in a democracy , in a monarchy , in a communist government , in any government that you want , the job of the government is to put the people in fear .\nAnd if you keep them in fear , you can get them to do anything that you want them to do , that they will turn into sheep .\nThere \u2019 s a famous book by Naomi Klein that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitalism .\nAnd that book shows\u2014it \u2019 s a historical chronology of all the times during American history , and in the history of the world , during the Great Depression , and during the financial collapse in 2008 , and during the financial collapse in Chile , for example , in 1973 , during the time of the World Trade Center bombing\u2014that authoritarian elements in a society , and large corporations and wealthy plutocrats and oligarchs , wealthy families and individuals , use crises to shift wealth upward , to obliterate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamp down totalitarian controls .\nOf course it \u2019 s an obvious thing that people who are used to voting for their governments are not going to vote for policies that make the rich people richer and give corporations even more power over their lives , that reduce democracy and reduce civil rights .\nThese are not good vessels for populism .\nIn order to transform the government so that it will reward the rich with even more wealth , the people who want to do that\u2014the large corporations who want to orchestrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil rights .\nAnd the first civil right that they begin with is freedom of speech .\nThey need to clamp down , censorship , because [ freedom from ] censorship is the most important right .\nIn our country we put it number one , the First Amendment of the Constitution , because all the other rights depend on it .\nIf a government can hide what it \u2019 s doing , it can get away with anything it wants .\nIf a corporation can lie and conceal information , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , you do not have a democracy .\nSo if you want to get rid of all the other rights , like freedom of assembly , which you are exercising today , some of you are exercising at great threats , some of you will suffer , some of you will be jailed , some of you will suffer injuries .\nBut that is a basic right : the right to freedom of expression , the right to a jury trial , the right to freedom of religion , the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that don \u2019 t spy on you and keep your information .\nAll of those other rights can only be subverted if they begin imposing censorship , by being able to silence people who want to speak .\nThe coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat that we are all fighting today is a coup d \u2019 etat that starts with a conspiracy between the government agencies and the big technology companies , Silicon Valley billionaires\u2014people like Zuckerberg and Bill Gates\u2014and the people who run Google and Facebook and Pinterest , and all of these other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conspiracy to make sure that we can not talk about our grievances .\nWe can not say bad things about pharmaceutical products .\nWe can not question government policies that make no sense to us .\nI \u2019 m going to say a few things about some of those government policies .\nNumber one , I am not a conspiracy theorist .\nI follow the facts .\nI don \u2019 t know that the COVID illness was laboratory generated in Wuhan .\nThere is plenty of evidence that it was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it \u2019 s a fact .\nBut my question is : why don \u2019 t we know the answer to that ?\nWhy is Tony Fauci not being asked that question ?\nWhy is President Trump not launching an investigation ?\nOr President Xi Jinping or the presidents of any of these countries ?\nWhere did this come from ?\nBecause we need to know that , the global citizens .\nThis is the worst calamity in history , and nobody seems curious about where this actually comes from .\nWe know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat in the wet market in Wuhan .\nThat story was a fable that now has no basis in fact .\nWe have Nobel laureates , and we have large institutions and investigative agencies and prosecutorial agencies are saying , \u201c We think it came from the Wuhan lab , and we think that it may have come from studies that were funded by Bill Gates and Tony Fauci .\nI don \u2019 t know if this is true , but why are our government officials not asking that as the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their police to suppress dissent , are they not sending the police , questioning the people who may know the answer to that question ?\nThere are many other questions that I \u2019 d like to know the answer .\nQuestions about masks .\nI \u2019 m very willing to accept if the masks work , then I want to wear them .\nIf they \u2019 re going to protect other people from transmissibility , then I want to wear them .\nBut the studies I \u2019 ve seen indicate that they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part .\nThere \u2019 s some that say they may work under limited circumstances .\nWhat I don \u2019 t want told is : they work and you \u2019 re going to wear them , and you better not ask questions about it .\nMost Americans and most of the people on this planet , we want leadership , but we don \u2019 t want bullying .\nWe know the difference between bullying and leadership .\nWe want to know the truth about hydroxychloroquine .\nWe want to know why we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $ 1.4 billion on therapeutic drugs .\nWhat is the sense of that ?\nThere are many , many other questions that we in a democracy have a right to have answered without being called conspiracy theorists , without being vilified as being \u201c inconsiderate \u201d or being \u201c bad citizens.\n\u201d Everybody who \u2019 s part of these demonstrations are people who are striving with their lives to become good citizens .\nNow let me tell you what we need to do to win this battle .\nThe only way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to fight to get our democracy back , to reclaim our democracy from these villains who are stealing it from us .\nAnd you notice the people who are getting richest from the quarantine are the same people who are censoring criticism of quarantine .\nWho \u2019 s becoming the richest ?\nJeffrey Bezos .\n$ 83 billion he \u2019 s made and he owns Amazon and he is censoring books that criticize the quarantine .\nZuckerberg who owns Facebook , who \u2019 s made tens of billions of dollars by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that is critical of the quarantine .\nHe censors my Instagram .\n.\nHe censors my Facebook , my Twitter page is also censored .\nAll of these people are people who are making billions of dollars on the quarantine .\nWhat I want to know is a simple question : Is the quarantine actually effective ?\nYou know , we \u2019 ve had plenty of pandemics in the past .\nIn 1969 , we had a Hong Know Flu pandemic that killed 100,000 people in the United States .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s the same number of people who are being killed by coronavirus .\nDid we go into lockdown ?\nNo .\nDid we wear masks ?\nNo .\nWe went to Woodstock .\nWe went to the Democratic Convention in Chicago and had huge crowds of people .\nNobody was told to lock down and don \u2019 t see your girlfriend and wear a mask and don \u2019 t go out of your house and shut down your business and bankrupt every business in the country .\nLast year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died from tuberculosis .\nWe have 1.6 million people die every year from tuberculosis .\nWe \u2019 re not wearing masks .\nWe \u2019 re not on lockdown .\nWhat \u2019 s the difference between tuberculosis and coronavirus ?\nTuberculosis has a vaccine and the vaccine costs about $ 3 , and that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re not on lockdown , because nobody is making $ 39 a vaccine or $ 300 a vaccine the way Moderna and AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson are making from this catastrophe .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of .\nI \u2019 m happy if somebody tells me there \u2019 s another reason .\nBut let \u2019 s hear it .\nDon \u2019 t just shut me up .\nDon \u2019 t just tell me that I can \u2019 t debate .\nHere \u2019 s what we need to do .\nWe need to do exactly what you \u2019 re doing today .\nWe need to come out on the street and we need to stick together .\nWhat the Big Tech villains and scoundrels and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do is they want us fighting with each other .\nThey want blacks fighting against whites , they want Republicans fighting against Democrats .\nThey want everybody polarized , they want everybody fragmented .\nThey know if we all get together , we \u2019 re going to start asking questions , and those are questions they can \u2019 t answers .\n\u201c Why are you getting rich ?\n\u201d and \u201c Why are we all getting poor ?\n\u201d And \u201c What \u2019 s the difference between tuberculosis and coronavirus ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wearing masks for tuberculosis , but we are for the coronavirus ?\n\u201d And , \u201c Where did it all come from ?\n\u201d All of those questions that we deserve an answer to that we \u2019 re not getting answers .\nWe need to stick together .\nIf you \u2019 re a Republican or a Democrat , stop talking about that .\nStop identifying yourself .\nThe enemy is Big Tech , Big Data , Big Oil , Big Pharma , the medical cartel , the government totalitarian elements that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of our liberties , of our democracy , of our freedom of thought , of our freedom of expression , of our freedom of assembly , and all the freedoms that give dignity to humanity .\nThe last thing that all of us need to do is we need to stay educated and informed .\nOne of the things I want to announce to you today is that Children \u2019 s Health Defense , my organization , with the help of many of you who are in these crowds\u2014is launching a journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to weaponize information for you .\nWe \u2019 re going to tell you what the newest science is .\nWe \u2019 re going to take all the information that is censored everywhere else , and we \u2019 re going to reprint it on our publication , and you can get that every day .\nSo if you see something that is censored , we want to hear about it because we want to put it up .\nWe are going to be the enemies of censorship .\nWe are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re going to allow debate .\nWe \u2019 re going to make sure it \u2019 s civil debate .\nWe \u2019 re going to encourage people to be non-partisan , but we \u2019 re going to allow people to comment and have different opinions than us .\nWe are not scared of debate the way pharmaceutical companies and Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeffrey Bezos and Tony Fauci are terrified of debate .\nWe welcome debate .\nWe want to hear if you \u2019 ve got a different opinion than me .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see your science .\nI want the public to hear us talking about it and debating about it because the free-flow of information , the cauldron of debate is the only thing that allows governments to develop rational policies in which self-governance will actually and triumph .\nYou are on the front lines of the most important battle in history and it is the battle to save democracy and freedom and human liberty and human dignity from this totalitarian cartel that is trying to rob us simultaneously in every nation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being is born with .\nThank you for your courage , thank you for your commitment , and thank you for your brotherhood .\nI can pledge to you that I will go down dying with my boots on , fighting side-by-side with all of you to make sure that we return these rights preserve them for our children .\nI will see all of you on the barricades .\nThank you .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Amanda Ruggeri ( below ) , who describes herself on her website as \u201c Journalist , Photographer , Traveler , Historian , Adventurer \u201d , and obviously a very exciting person .\nShe also has not replied .\nWhat I did not know at the time that I wrote to Zaria was that before writing her amusing vaccine fairy story she had interviewed Prof Exley at length on the phone .\nYesterday , he wrote to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'likes ' something or not .\nIt is about your integrity as a journalist .\nYou contacted me by email to ask my advice .\nI was happy to help and even gave you my home telephone number since you wished to talk to me personally and not simply correspond by email .\nWe talked for about forty minutes .\nI shared with you a great deal of scientific , published , information on our expertise in aluminium adjuvants used in vaccines .\nI made sure that you had access to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI also gave you some background on adjuvants generally .\nYou gave the impression of both being very interested in the information I gave you and also of being grateful for my time and expertise .\nAfterall we are , arguably , the world 's leading group researching the efficacy and safety of aluminium adjuvants used in vaccines .\nWhen we finished our conversation , you promised to send me a link to your article .\nYou did not do this and reading your article , I can understand why .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your article once but when opportunities arose you chose to write what can only be described as blatant lies .\nFor example , even though you knew that what you had written was untrue you still wrote ; There is as little as 0.2mg of aluminium in a typical vaccine dose , which is equivalent to less than the weight of a single poppy seed .\nThere is no evidence that any of the adjuvants currently in use lead to side-effects .\nApart from being factually incorrect the comparison with a poppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to your editor 's mantra concerning BBC Future ; We believe in truth , facts , and science .\nWe take the time to think .\nAnd we do n't accept \u2014 we ask why .\nI told you everything you needed to know about how much aluminium is used in vaccines .\nI even shared with you some of our new research in this field about to be published in the BMJ .\nI pointed out to you that there are serious adverse events caused by aluminium adjuvants and I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find this information , no lesser document than the patient information leaflet provided with every vaccine .\nYour writing about DPT is completely false and while we did not discuss this you could have checked this information with me at any time .\nYou clearly chose not to check your information .\nI told you the story of Glenny and the 'discovery ' of aluminium adjuvants .\nI also made sure that you understood which aluminium salts were used as aluminium adjuvants .\nInstead you wrote lies again about this ; To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in the form of salts .\nThese include aluminium hydroxide ( commonly used as an antacid to relieve indigestion and heartburn ) , aluminium phosphate ( often used in dental cement ) and potassium aluminium sulphate , which is sometimes found in baking powder .\nYou decided instead to write complete scientific nonsense in your descriptions of aluminium salts used in vaccines , why is beyond me when you had access to the correct information .\nWhat were you trying to do , make the aluminium salts sound benign by comparing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that the main reason why aluminium adjuvants are effective is because they are toxic at the vaccine injection site .\nI spoke to you at length about this and I pointed you towards the relevant peer reviewed published scientific literature .\nYour reference to uric acid at this point did not come from me and has no relevance .\nThis article is very shoddy journalism .\nIt seems to have been primarily informed by a Chinese scientist working on vaccines in China .\nAs the world 's leading researcher on aluminium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that they have no expertise in aluminium adjuvants .\nWhy you chose to only follow their advice is insulting .\nIf you and your editors do truly 'believe in truth , facts , and science ' , then I would expect a right of reply to this inaccurate and scientifically inept article .\nTo not do so would suggest that the written lies therein have an alternative agenda .\nSo far , at the time of writing , Prof Exley assures me he has heard neither from Zaria Gorvett or her editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you would

experiences as a actual Holocaust survivor and someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical community firsthand .\nBy Anne Dachel Thank you to my Facebook friend , Dara Silverman-Berger .\nDara sent me the link to this powerful interview of Vera Sharav which I transcribed below .\nThe work that you have done is immeasurable and the benefit to society is truly eternal .\nSo we thank you for standing in the gap and fighting for the moral and ethical issues that often go unseen if there weren \u2019 t people like you fighting on our behalf .\nVera : Thank you so much .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to share some of your experiences as a child and as an adult that led to your value in safe guarding and protecting informed consent and parental rights .\nVera : I was a small child , three and a half years old when our family was chased out of our home in Romania , and we were herded into a concentration camp .\nMy father soon died of typhus , and my mother and I were left in a camp that was not a death camp .\nThere were many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left to starve , but with always the fear of being sent to one of the death camps .\nThat was always in the horizon .\nI was in the camp for about two years , and at that point they were supposed to essentially liquidate it , as they were going to do with all the camps and just annihilate everyone .\nThere was a deal made by which orphan children were allowed to be sent out of the camp if they had someone to sign for them .\nMy mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was not exactly an orphan , but this was to save my life .\nI wound up , for about a year , going from one family to another .\nIt kind of strange , you know , how a child absorbs these kinds of trauma .\nFor many years I didn \u2019 t really touch it .\nI didn \u2019 t allow it to come out in my consciousness because it \u2019 s so painful .\nI can \u2019 t stress how awful it is for a child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s really , really devastating in the sense of , even though I was not mistreated by anyone along the way , but the sense of self-worth goes very , very deep .\nSo after this year of wandering from one family to the other , it \u2019 s a long story , I was on my way to my mother \u2019 s sister in Israel .\nI had befriended a family on the train to the ships that were to take us from Romania , because I was sent back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way was in Ukraine .\nOn the train I befriended a family and I got attached to them .\nOne of the things that I learned as this wandering child is to choose , to select grownups that I could trust .\nI was little and I did not trust to be with my peers , with other children who were bigger and all that because I knew I would not do well with them .\nI needed an adult .\nI wanted adults .\nWhen we got to where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three boats were to go , and they had lists of who was to go on which boat .\nI was supposed to go on a boat with the orphan children .\nThe whole boat was going to be with the orphans , but I refused .\nI refused to be separated from this family that I had become attached to .\nThis is a very searing memory .\nThere I was .\nEveryone was on one of the three boats and I was sitting on my little valise just crying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , no matter what .\nOf course in today \u2019 s milieu , that would have been ADHD , oppositional defiant disorder and all sorts of things like that .\nThis was one of the most important lessons that I learned that I would say people should think about .\nThis is a child , you know .\nBy then I was six years old .\nAs we left and from Romania it was to Istanbul .\nFrom there we then took a train to Israel , which was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , while I was asleep\u2014I was very seasick\u2014a submarine drowned the boat with all the children .\nAnd when they told me , I didn \u2019 t say anything , but I knew that I saved my own life by being oppositional defiant disorder .\nThat \u2019 s a lesson that right now is very needed .\nAdults now are not rebelling against things that are wrong .\nPeople are being pushed around .\nDenied normal interaction , and they \u2019 re just following it like sheep .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s wrong is the idea of just following authority without considering , what if they \u2019 re wrong ?\nWhat if it \u2019 s not in my best interest ?\nWhy ?\nThis is very dangerous that we have so many people , good people , people who think that they \u2019 re doing the right thing community-wise .\nBut they might be devastating both the community , the economy\u2014of course has been destroyed , and their health as well , just following without questioning .\nAs I say , this incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I am , why I have been sounding alarms when I recognize that they \u2019 re alarming .\nIt \u2019 s a very , very dangerous thing to do to follow .\nThat \u2019 s what happened in Germany essentially .\nAll Germans were not evil , but most of them , the vast majority , simply went along .\nAnd yes , of course , it was wartime , and we \u2019 re always being told about war , and now it \u2019 s a war on a virus .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights and basic respect for individuals .\nIt starts\u2014and medicine especially which is so intertwined as it was then\u2014when medicine veers away from the Hippocratic Oath , which is an oath that promises to respect the individual rights , to do no harm to the individual .\nIf you don \u2019 t harm the individual , you \u2019 re not going to harm the community , but if you wipe out the individual \u2019 s right , their human right , then you \u2019 re going to harm the community as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals .\nIt \u2019 s not some other entity .\nLeah : Yes , it seems that there \u2019 s been a confusion .\nPeople [ in ] authority have tried to make it confusing as to whether what \u2019 s good for me , if that can possibly be good for the whole , or if I should be looking out for the whole before myself .\nThat \u2019 s become such a source of confusion for many people during [ this ] national crisis .\nVera : Look , going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother made , this was a terrible choice that she had to make , and it was to save my life .\nIt had nothing to do with community , but it was a sacrifice that she\u2014as a mother , this is what motherhood is about .\nYou need to sacrifice for your children .\nLeah : The community can only be as strong as the individuals that make it up .\nIs that what I hear you saying ?\nVera : Absolutely , certainly in a moral level , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny the human individual the right to think and question and assess and make decisions based on their own judgment and experience , then you are creating robots .\nLeah : When did you first put together your passion for informed consent and safeguarding these rights with your experience as a six year old girl standing up for yourself ?\nVera : That came later when I did a lot of research .\nI did want to know how could it happen .\nOne of the things when I came out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world went on .\nWhere were they ?\nWhere was everybody ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t anybody stop this ?\nI couldn \u2019 t understand that .\nThat was my moral judgment .\nSo I did a lot of reading and things , and that \u2019 s when I realized that one of the worse things that happened , aside from\u2014you know , cause the Holocaust is mainly focused on Jews because they wanted to annihilate the entire Jewish people .\nThat \u2019 s where that is .\nIt took time for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first victims of the Nazi regime were children , disabled children .\nThey were taken from their families .\nThey organized a whole system whereby schools would identify them , at birth they were identified .\nTheir names would be sent to the central government , and then they rounded up the children , took them away from their parents and told the parents that they were going to be given special treatment .\nOf course that was a lie .\nThey took them , and it was doctors , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the selections of which children were going to be used for experiments before they were killed .\nThe experiments included starvation , to see how long a child can subsist on practically no nutrition .\nAnd they would record all this very methodically .\nAnd they tested the Zyklon B which was later used in the gas chambers .\nSo it began with the children , it then got expanded to mentally ill adults and eventually the nursing homes , the elderly .\nThe Nazis called them \u201c worthless eaters , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID 19 pandemic , nursing home residents in the United States , in Europe , were the largest percentage of casualties .\nThis did not happen by chance .\nYes , people in nursing homes , the elderly , with all kinds of ailments are vulnerable , and everyone was told , because of these vulnerable old people , we must shut down society , [ because ] we have to protect them .\nThat was an absolute lie .\nThose people were targeted to die .\nIn New York , our governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State health commissioner , issued an order that older people coming to a hospital should be turned to a nursing home , with or without testing whether they had COVID or not , and disregarding completely that those nursing homes were completely ill-equipped .\nThey had no protective gear , they had no way to separate .\nThese are not hospitals , but they \u2019 re also understaffed , under-resourced .\nI mean they didn \u2019 t have masks , they had nothing , so of course a very , very high percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given treatment .\nThis is a crime .\nLeah : So based on age , the order was that they should , upon admission to the hospital , be transferred to a facility .\nVera : Right , they did not want to treat them in the hospital , right .\nLeah : There was no protocols in place to make sure they were receiving the care that they needed .\nVera : And what happened is in fact that both the elderly and staff , the caregivers , they also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because one of the things that really is true with this virus , is it depends on how much that you are infected .\nAt first we were told , oh the doorknobs and all this sort of thing\u2014that \u2019 s all nonsense .\nIt \u2019 s really how much of the virus do you come in contact with .\nLeah : The concentration of it .\nVera : Yes , that \u2019 s right , and these care givers , they were right there without any help , without any protection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ others whom they went and cared for because one caregiver would be taking care of a whole lot of them .\nIt \u2019 s a horror .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of horror that really there should be accountability .\nThere should be a real investigation how this happens .\nLeah : So when you \u2019 re drawing these parallels between what you \u2019 ve seen in history and what you \u2019 re seeing now , is it offensive to compare Nazism to what \u2019 s happening in America today ?\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s the history .\nSome have gone on trial , some have been executed .\nHistory has told that story , not fully but to a great degree .\nBut here no one is held accountable at all , in fact , Governor Cuomo gave the nursing homes total immunity .\nIt \u2019 s unheard of that this should happen today in 2020 , and this is called a civilized way of dealing with a public health emergency .\nLeah : So what I hear you saying is it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a leap , it \u2019 s not extreme to compare what we \u2019 re seeing to what we \u2019 ve seen in the past .\nVera : I think each one needs to evaluate it themselves .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter whether I link it [ to ] Nazism .\nThat \u2019 s not the point .\nThe point is : what was done , what were the policies , what was the rationale ?\nThey had a similar rationale .\nRemember , they wanted to get rid of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nTheir economy was very bad at the time .\nThis was wartime .\nEverything was going for the war , and civilians didn \u2019 t have enough to eat as well .\nThere were shortages and all that .\nSo this was their way of dealing for the \u201c volk , \u201d for the \u201c volk.\n\u201d Forget the individual .\nWhat I \u2019 m suggesting is that when you eliminate the sanctity of the individual person , you are crossing that line .\nYou \u2019 re no better .\nLeah : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nazism , how were the people convinced to look out for the volk instead of for themselves or their individual loved ones .\nHow did that look in the very beginning ?\nVera : Under the Nazi regime , and the same thing happened under the Soviet regime and under the Chinese regime .\nYou have a dictatorship that is running the society with fear , constant fear and surveillance .\nThey used at that time what they could , which today is not comparable at all .\nToday one can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of technologies .\nBut I do want to say one thing , another similar use of technology .\nVery few people know this actually , but IBM had a contract with Nazi Germany and they supplied their punch card technology , which enabled the Nazis to identify and round up European Jewry .\nThat \u2019 s what surveillance is for , and that \u2019 s how they were able to actually root out almost every Jew in Europe and send them to camps .\nThat was the IBM contribution to the Holocaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it have been so efficient because this was industrialized murder .\nThat \u2019 s how .\nThis is business .\nThis is big business .\nIBM , they had plants in different parts of Europe because they were selling their technology just as Bill Gates sells his technology .\nThis was a business , and in fact I \u2019 ve read also recently in some concentration camps they actually had the IBM machine with the punch card to decide which one is to be exterminated under which shift and whatever .\nOh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial business .\nLeah : So how did your journey as an activist begin , protecting informed consent and digging into these issues here in the States ?\nVera : It began really with tragedy , a different tragedy .\nMy firstborn son developed a mental illness , and I had to deal with the mental health system which is a terrible place .\nAnd this is right here in New York with all the top hospitals and all that .\nThe psychiatric community , those who are really ill , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , when someone with a mental illness , if they claim let \u2019 s say to be abused\u2014no one believes them .\nThey \u2019 re disqualified because they \u2019 re mentally ill .\nThey can \u2019 t , even if it even got to that kind of thing where they have to testify let \u2019 s say in court , they would be disqualified because they \u2019 re mentally ill. Leah : Lack of capacity .\nSo their voice is totally silent .\nVera : That \u2019 s right .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them .\nThey need an advocate .\nAnd one of the tragedies in that whole system is there was a shift , a business model has taken over completely which is drug centered , pharmaceutical drug centered , and by now it \u2019 s drug cocktails .\nIt \u2019 s not even just one drug .\nIt \u2019 s lots of drugs .\nThose drugs , every one of them has serious side effects , so that taking the drug for let \u2019 s say depression , there are tradeoffs which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re not told and neither are their parents .\nThose drugs cause diabetes , okay ?\nThey make people suicidal , \u2026arrhythmias .\nThis is now known , but you see at the time the drugs were launched , they didn \u2019 t admit to any of these adverse effects .\nThese are wonder drugs .\nThis is like penicillin , like antibiotics .\nThat was a lie , but it was a marketing lie .\nVera : Well , the companies while testing them , yes , some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t disclose that , so as a result my son died as a result of the medication that he was prescribed .\nThe point is that the New York State Department of Mental Health , they tried to make the coroner change his cause of death on the death certificate .\nWell he wouldn \u2019 t .\nBut they went that far .\nThey wanted to hide , to conceal the fact that the drug caused total organ arrest .\nIt killed him .\nThey didn \u2019 t want that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug as the first line .\nIt was the recommended drug to use .\nLeah : It was the standard of care .\nVera : And that \u2019 s what it actually did .\nIn other words , the risk surrounding the drug was concealed , and that \u2019 s how things have been with many drugs , most of the psychiatric drugs .\nIt only came out once they were no longer the exclusive patent .\nThe drug , once it wasn \u2019 t making as much money , then slowly things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is though that once you realize that this whole medical establishment has been lying , has been a party to a lie , to a very serious lie and people are dying , and it \u2019 s not even being counted as being a result of the drug .\nI realized I have to look further .\nBefore this happened actually , because I started to advocate , to look for the right treatments and so forth , someone anonymously sent me an article from the American Journal of Psychiatry in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Bronx VA .\nThey were mental patients .\nThey had schizophrenia , but most them had been living in the community .\nSo in other words , they were in remission .\nThey took them back to the hospital , took them off all medications that they \u2019 d been on , and they gave them L-dopa .\nL-dopa is a drug that \u2019 s used for Parkinson \u2019 s , but L-dopa is known to cause psychosis .\nEvery one of them who had been in remission essentially had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a government-sponsored experiment .\nNow when I read it , the first I said , this isn \u2019 t possible .\nThis is in the United States , these are veterans .\nI sent it to two psychiatrists that I knew , and I said , \u201c Am I reading this correctly ?\nIs this what they did ?\n\u201d And one of them was the chairman of psychiatry at Long Island Jewish\u2026 and he said yes .\nThis is deliberately causing patients to have psychotic relapses .\nWhat could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same .\nThey don \u2019 t feel that these patients are human beings .\nThey used their ability to exploit them and to exploit the Veterans Administration hospital to do this kind of research .\nThat was the first complaint that I filed with the federal oversight agency .\nThey changed names , but doesn \u2019 t matter .\nAnd this was all done with the approval of the so-called institutional review boards which are supposed to be the watchdog within an institution before research on people is done , but it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera references the tetanus vaccine being given to newborns at birth .\nActually it \u2019 s the hepatitis B vaccine that \u2019 s given at birth . ]\nAnd that was the first , and then I had a whole series of similar experiments that were done , many on children as well .\nThis was during the 90s and 2000 , around that time .\nBut it \u2019 s been\u2014things have not gotten better .\nThey \u2019 ve actually gotten worse , because now mother isn \u2019 t asked even when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her baby a tetanus vaccine .\nWhy [ is ] a baby \u2019 s given tetanus vaccines ?\nIt makes absolutely no sense in a medical way , but if you have contracts and business to worry about , then I guess it makes sense .\nBut these babies are being used .\nLeah : And that \u2019 s an example of the deviation from the Hippocratic Oath .\nIt \u2019 s no longer looking at the patient as first do no harm , but there \u2019 s contracts in place that muddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt begins in the public health arena .\nPublic health is government , and that is what happened in Nazi Germany .\nAll of medicine wound up being public health .\nOnce you have medicine in partnership with government , there is no individual care .\nThe Hippocratic Oath goes out the window .\nAnd since you have government behind you , the doctor \u2019 s not responsible for their actions .\nThey \u2019 re working together with the state .\nThat \u2019 s when medicine becomes weaponized .\nAnd what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you dictate what medicine is given to your child , and you don \u2019 t have a say , that invites all kinds of really serious violations of your child and your role .\nYou know children are sometimes taken away from their parents , if the parent refuses , for example with psychiatric drugs .\nADHD , if you don \u2019 t agree to give your child , they \u2019 ve taken children away .\nThat \u2019 s called Child Protective Services .\nWho are they protecting ?\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many areas now where there \u2019 s been a complete incursion into private families .\nWho is to say ?\nWhere is the evidence that government knows best for what \u2019 s for your child ?\nThere is no such thing .\nIt \u2019 s only if you give in and you obey\u2026then you \u2019 re not meeting your responsibility as [ the parent of ] a child .\nParents have to be willing to go to battle to protect their children .\nLeah : And that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are infantilizing adult men and women and saying the state knows best for you and for your child .\nAnd so we \u2019 re expected as parents , to willingly give up our parental rights and our health care rights and give them to the state and into state mandates .\nI \u2019 ll ask you a hard question admittedly , because we \u2019 re all in this together , but how do parents go to bat ?\nVera : They have to organize .\nThey have to organize .\nIt doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up .\nIt \u2019 s enough if a certain number does .\nThere is more awareness .\nThere is more combativeness .\nIn Europe , in fact in Germany , Germany has had some very , very large rallies .\nI mean I \u2019 m talking 50,000 rallies against

to take seriously .\nBut , like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what viruses do .\nViruses replicate , they lysate ( break down the cell \u2019 s protein wall ) , and they spread to other host cells hoping

of a coronavirus .\nAnd then on top of that , it \u2019 s giving people symptoms that are not anywhere near consistent with the way viruses behave in the body .\nThen you have Anthony Fauci , in

person supposed when we see that the illness that people are getting with COVID 19 is supposed to be a coronavirus infection , and yet it \u2019 s not even close to being consistent with the way coronavirus operates in the body ?\nWhat is a medical doctor or a scientist or a lay person supposed when he or she finds out that Anthony Fauci is quoted in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying there will be a surprise outbreak during the Trump administration .\nEvery time these questions have been raised , people have been censored .\nWhen we \u2019 ve talked about the use of two anti-parasite drugs effectively helping as a treatment for people who got sick early on and they got better really quickly .\nWhy is that information censored ?\nWhy are the questions that I ask censored ?\nIt makes us wonder if dissenting opinion is no longer welcome in society .\nAnd then one has to wonder , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in where a give and take of different ideas or dissenting ideas and opinions are not welcome in the mainstream media ?\nThe next question : What can we do about it ?\nOne of the things I think is needed in our society at this time on this planet on this earth right now is for people to keep an open mind , to critically think and to not be convinced of how certain they are about the information that they \u2019 ve been given .\nIn my understanding of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is intuition .\nTwo is though what people tell you is true .\nAnd three by you discovering the truth and knowledge on your own , through your own research and through your own experience .\nWe are losing one and three .\nWe are losing our ability to use our intuition .\nWe \u2019 re losing our ability to critically think , to discover answers and to do our own research and have our own experiences .\nWe are watching a society and a world where the only thing that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities tell us to be true .\nWe are externalizing our authority .\nWe are externalizing our power .\nWe \u2019 re giving it up to false gods and false prophets who we are trusting to guide us and take care of us properly .\nBut the information doesn \u2019 t seem consistent with being able to trust of all of what they \u2019 re saying .\nSo I am asking people to give up their certainty , to be okay with doubt , to be okay with unknown , to be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them or opposite to what they thought they knew .\nBut don \u2019 t learn it because I , as an expert , might say it to you .\nLearn it because you thought it through , because you discussed it , because you worked it through , because you tried to look at things from all angles .\nYou were willing to be wrong and willing to grow into greater information and greater truth than what was handed to you by the authorities to whom you gave your power .\nAnne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Kennedy , Jr. and Georgia Republican Congressman Buddy Carter who received the Pfizer trial vaccine .\nThere \u2019 s also a lot of resistance from folks who say they are very suspicious of this and other vaccines , but is there solid reason to worry ?\nThere are some major challenges .\nThe vaccine has to be kept at 94 degrees below zero\u2026 Montgomery : Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer now says it is ready and waiting on FDA approval to begin distributing its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 vaccines simultaneously in development around the globe .\nIt was appropriate that Fox Business aired this interview .\nThe real purpose of producing millions of vaccines with little to no health benefit is BUSINESS , BIG BUSINESS , and that \u2019 s what it \u2019 s all about really .\nNOTHING Kennedy brought up was addressed .\nHe talked about the expectations of the COVID vaccine .\nOfficials have publicly admitted that the vaccine won \u2019 t have the potential to prevent transmissibility , hospitalizations , or deaths from coronavirus .\nCarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s charge that no one has any idea what the long term side effects of this vaccine may be .\nInstead Carter assured viewers that the drug industry and the FDA only produce and approve safe and effective products .\n( It seems he missed the damage from Vioxx , conservatively 60,000 deaths . )\nRep. Carter , who \u2019 s also a pharmacist , also neatly ignored the reality that Kennedy pointed out , namely that no one is responsible for any damage or death resulting from this vaccine .\nMontgomery \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done absolutely no background research before this interview .\nShe knew nothing about how the vaccine industry operates .\nFox anchor , fast- talking , Lisa Kennedy Montgomery refused to let Kennedy explain that the pharmaceutical industry has no liability for damage from the much-touted COVID vaccine and therefore little incentive to produce a truly safe one .\nShe wasn \u2019 t about to allow him to raise any concerns about the vaccine .\nShe adamantly claimed that the vaccine makers do have liability for injuries .\nBy Anne Dachel This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with Robert Kennedy , Jr. and U.S. Rep .\nBuddy Carter ( GA ) regarding the development of the COVID vaccine in an obvious attempt to promote the vaccine and downplay worries about side effects .\nCongressman Carter was asked about his experience taking a trial vaccine .\nHe has received two doses of the vaccine , but it is a double blind study so he doesn \u2019 t know if he received the actual COVID vaccine .\nMontgomery : All right .\nSo Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general with vaccines and their safety , what might be in them , the side effects that vaccines might cause .\nThere are a lot of people who share your concern , and that concern has only grown with coronavirus .\nSo what is it specifically about the coronavirus vaccine that concerns you so much ?\nKennedy : One of the many companies that are developing vaccines come up with a vaccine that does what we all want a vaccine to do , which is you take a shot , you have immunity\u2014long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and it prevents transmissibility , prevents hospitalizations and deaths , and I would be the first one to get in line to take it .\nI want to commend Congressman Carter for standing up for this .\nThe problem with this particular vaccine is really the design of this study .\nThe British Medical Journal , and associate editor Peter Doshi has written articles about this specific criticism in the BMJ and in the New York Times , in which he shows that the design of the study is not designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t know that this vaccine prevents transmissibility .\nIf it doesn \u2019 t prevent transmissibility , then it \u2019 s not going to end the lockdown .\nIn fact it will turn us all into asymptomatic carriers and perhaps make the disease much worse .\nThe study is not designed to show that it prevents deaths or hospitalizations .\nFinally , the study is not designed to show that it prevents injuries , at least longer term injures .\nMany of the injuries that are associated with vaccination are developmental injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long diagnostic horizons .\nThey have long incubation periods .\nYou won \u2019 t see them over a 45 day period .\nWe should be willing to trade speed for safety when it comes to developing a coronavirus vaccine , according to Fox Business Montgomery : I understand that , but for a lot of people who have lost family members or those who have gotten sick themselves , they know we can \u2019 t wait 14 years which is the average amount of time that it takes for a vaccine to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mumps vaccine has been the fastest , that was done in about four years .\nSo Congressman , can you address some of those concerns ?\nDid you have any of those worries yourself about the fact that we may be asymptotic carriers ?\nDid that worry you ?\nThere \u2019 s nothing to worry about Carter : \u2026It is phenomenal that we are getting this vaccine in this quick of time .\nBut if you look at the way it \u2019 s being done , I \u2019 m very confident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m doing it myself , that it will be safe , and it will be effective .\nThat \u2019 s very important .\nYou were right .\nGenerally it does a much longer time to come up with a vaccine , but what they \u2019 re doing , what the FDA is doing , first of all , it \u2019 s all hands on deck , this is all they \u2019 re working on right now Secondly , they are overlapping phases .\nNormally what you would do is you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review period , then start the next phase .\nThey \u2019 re eliminating that review period .\nThey \u2019 re still doing the review , but they \u2019 re just having the company go ahead and start the next phase .\nAnother thing they \u2019 re doing is they \u2019 re having the companies go ahead , make the vials , make the syringes\u2014everything you need , so that when it is approved , you can immediately get it to market .\nThat \u2019 s extremely important .\nMontgomery : We talked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that \u2019 s hoping that nanotechnology is the future of vaccines because that way you \u2019 re not injecting an actual live vaccine , or even a dead vaccine into someone .\nThrough nanotechnology you are targeting exactly what you want to suppress , unlike the flu vaccine which is like throwing a handful of spaghetti at a wall .\nSo Robert , would you be in favor of something like that if the technology completely shifted ?\nWould you be more trusting of that sort of virus prophylaxis ?\nKennedy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies out of the same studies we force every other medicine to go through .\nThe problem with this vaccine is the one that Pfizer is currently putting out\u2014and Tony Fauci says this\u2014the vaccine does not prevent transmissibility .\nIF it doesn \u2019 t prevent transmissibility , what \u2019 s the point ?\nIt \u2019 s not going to stop the lockdown .\nIF the vaccine does not prevent hospitalization , what \u2019 s the point ?\nIf it doesn \u2019 t prevent deaths , what \u2019 s the point ?\nThe way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this vaccine prevents minor symptoms of COVID in people under 55 years old .\nThose are not the people we \u2019 re concerned about .\nThose are not the people who are dying from COVID .\nThe people who are dying are the fragile elderly\u2014 But Congressman Carter , to Pfizer \u2019 s point there \u2019 s no way they would invest two billion dollars in their own research and development in order to sicken the globe .\nWhen you have private market forces at work , they want to succeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming people .\nThey don \u2019 t succeed with vaccination failure .\nWould you like to speak to that ?\nKennedy : There are no market forces here .\nThere \u2019 s no liability here if they injury somebody .\nMontgomery : They go out of business .\nThat \u2019 s the thing about the free market the liability you take on entirely yourself because if it doesn \u2019 t work , you go out of business and you lose everything .\nKennedy : You made an erroneous statement here .\nThese companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do .\nKennedy : They have no liability Montgomery : Yes , they do , and if they injury you there are class action lawsuits .\nAll you have to do is watch any news channel , especially this one .\nKennedy : I \u2019 m sorry , but you \u2019 re wrong\u2026 .\nI \u2019 m sorry but you \u2019 re totally wrong .\nCongressman Carter got to talk next and he explained that the FDA approval process is a \u201c very strenuous process.\n\u201d Carter : These scientists are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine on the market that \u2019 s going to harm people .\n\u2026 Vaccines are one of the most lifesaving innovations that we \u2019 ve ever had in medicine .\nThere is no excuse why we should not bring this to market .\nThat it will be safe and effective , as approved by the FDA There \u2019 s no excuse that shouldn \u2019 t get this to market as soon as possible .\nIt will save lives .\nMontgomery : I think it \u2019 s okay to be skeptical of vaccines .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be skeptical of the FDA , but I do share your optimism that through the private free market we will find a way to defeat this virus .\nThe video shows FACTS DO

the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( NVICP ) and the second , a more secretive program called the CounterMeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) .\nThere is a lot of speculation on where any injuries or death suffered by the American public will be adjudicated once COVID-19 vaccines are approved and distributed .\nThere are two specific and distinctive federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death .\nFirst , the CICP does not allow the petitioner to seek reimbursement of attorney fees not medical expert costs .\nIn the NVICP , these costs are reimbursable even when the petitioner loses as long as the initial claim was shown to have a reasonable basis .\nThese costs can run on average of $ 35,000 to $ 75,000 and as high as $ 300,000 .\nI doubt if many petitioners can afford this cost out of their own pocket .\nSo you are basically on your own .\nJust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA second reason is when you submit your petition , copies of your medical records need to be included .\nAnd that is all .\nIn the NVICP , generally your attorney will also submit research studies , expert reports to support your claim .\nNot so in the CICP .\nA third reason .\nIf you are one of the very few who have been compensated in the CICP ( 8 % ) , there is no award for pain & suffering .\nNo award for loss of future wages .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $ 250,000 for pain & suffering .\nCurrently , nearly 74 % of all claims are compensated in the NVICP , granted the vast majority are influenza vaccines administered to adults claiming shoulder injury or GBS .\nA forth reason .\nThere is no judicial appeal process .\nNo higher court to appeal .\nIn the CICP , the appeal process is limited to appealing to the Sec \u2019 y of HHS who determined the fate of your petition in the first place .\nRenee Gentry , a Washington DC based attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted on my podcast Right on Point , with the following : \u201c In the CICP , you have the right to file a petition and lose.\n\u201d Think about that .\nYou can listen to the entire podcast with Renee Gentry , Peter Meyers and myself discussing the CICP .\nThe episode will be released Tuesday prior to Thanksgiving .\nSorry to spoil your family gathering and Turkey Dinner .\nBut it might be better to listen than participate in a family discussion of politics at the dinner table .\nCheck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional podcasts .\nA fifth reason .\nThe decisions are not public .\nIn the NVICP , the Federal Court of Claims publishes decisions from the Vaccine Court on a daily basis .\nIn the CICP , there is no public disclosure .\nA couple of attorneys and myself have been trying to break down the door and place a spotlight on the decisions .\nMy FOIA \u2019 s ranging over the last 8 years have been denied .\nAnd I am not asking for names , addresses or personal information .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question and the alleged injuries .\nThat is all .\nSoon , we will be marching to Federal Court in hopes of having a judge compel HRSA to turn over these documents .\nI think the public has a right to know where their tax dollars are being used .\nSpeaking of tax dollars , the entire compensation fund for the CICP is not a set aside account that is funded by a levy on vaccines sold .\nIt is an appropriation from Congress to HRSA to pay out any claims as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of the CICP , we have been able to determine the total payout is approximately $ 5.7 million for 39 claims representing 8 % of all petitions filed .\nThanks to Peter Meyers and a response to his FOIA filed earlier this .\nThe problem facing Congress is how to fund the CICP because of the pending several hundred million doses of COVID-19 to be administered over the course of the next year .\nJust multiplying the estimated doses by the ratio of adverse events in the clinical trials suggests there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential volume of people affected \u201c will be too much for some unfunded compensation program , \u201d said Richard Topping , currently chief legal officer of CareSource Management Group Inc. , a Dayton , Ohio-based non-profit that \u2019 s one of the nation \u2019 s largest Medicaid-managed health care plans .\nMr .\nTopping is a former DOJ attorney that represented the Sec \u2019 y of HHS in the NVICP .\nAnother reason why the CICP is a horrible program .\nThe statute of limitations is only 1 year .\n365 days only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the NVICP , you have 3 years for injury and 2 years for death .\nHow many people will develop autoimmune disorders and other medical ailments that might not manifest itself as an injury until it \u2019 s too late ?\nAnd if you have not determined your medical condition was the result of the COVID-19 vaccine until 9 months later , good luck trying to get ALL of your medical records together and filed with your petition with the short time remaining .\nI believe that the short SOL is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or a couple of weeks from vaccination .\nIf you develop an autoimmune disorder such as severe asthma or aggravation of an underlying medical condition , you are probably not going to be able to file a petition on time .\nSeveral years ago , there were many petitions originally filed in the NVICP claiming H1N1 vaccine caused a specific medical condition .\nThe NVICP was so backed up , by the time the HRSA staff processed the petition and forwarded to a Special Master , they could only dismiss because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd the Statute of Limitations ( SOL ) already expired for the petitioner to file in the CICP .\nThat is not right , not just .\nThe petitioner was indeed SOL .\nThere are some arguments to keep the COVID-19 injury petitions in the CICP .\nChildren have been treated horribly in the NVICP regarding their petitions on a whole , have been dismissed .\nBut the treatment or justice they will receive in the CICP is be a lot harsher .\nIn FY2019 , nearly 94 % of all compensated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made the reason for this was the extreme high number of adult claims filed versus petitions submitted on the behalf of children .\nThe number of children petitions have been decreasing for the last 7 years .\nMy data from tracking petitions in the NVICP show the annual number of petitions on behalf of children filed has been decreasing .\nWhat could account for this ?\nHow about our government deciding that children who suffer seizures and early onset of epilepsy from DTaP are no longer compensatable .\nTeens who suffer debilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nParents who babies die just hours after receiving their 2 month old vaccines can no longer bring a claim of SIDS .\nThe courts are making sure the attorneys are not bring these claims forward and refusing to pay for attorney fees and medical costs .\nThus , attorneys are now aggressively screening potential clients and turning many of them away .\nTo keep it in the CICP will be worse for children AND adults than the treatment their claims will receive in the NVICP .\nWithout public disclosure , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adults who have been harmed by a COVID-19 It appears that the COVID-19 vaccines are here to stay .\nAnd probably follow the same course as the H1N1 vaccine .\nWhen first introduced , the CICP handled any claims until it was approved to be added into the trivalent flu vaccine which protect against an influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus , an influenza A ( H3N2 ) virus and one influenza B virus .\nSo if COVID-19 will become a standard vaccine for the American public , it makes more sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NVICP as soon as possible .\nThe public needs to know what injuries are occurring as the result of any COVID-19 vaccine .\nAuthor of The Vaccine Court \u2013 The Dark Truth to America \u2019 s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and The

the public by December or early next year , some governments are pushing for a mandatory vaccine program , as in Denmark where it was met with protests .\nThe national government in Denmark had to abandon a new law that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens took to the streets to protest by banging on pots and pans against an updated Epidemic Act ( pdf ) that gave the government an unprecedented amount of power to implement rules and extreme measures to fight against the CCP ( Chinese Communist Party ) virus pandemic .\nThe new Epidemic Act would replace the temporary amended law ( pdf ) that was unanimously and quickly passed back on March 12 in response to the pandemic .\nAt that time , one of the major revisions made involved transferring all the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to the Danish Minister of Health to allow for a quicker response to COVID-19 .\nBut this gave a lot of power to the minister of health who is able to \u201c access a person \u2019 s home with the police assistance without prior court order , \u201d and \u201c use police assistance to isolate , examine or treat a person who is infected or believed to be infected with one of the communicable diseases listed in the appendix to the Act , \u201d according to a blog by Janne Rothmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copenhagen .\nThe minister of health through a Ministerial Order was also able to limit the gathering of more than 10 people at indoor or outdoor public spaces except for \u201c political meetings/protests , supermarkets , and places of work , etc.\n\u201d The new Act would continue keeping the centralized powers with the Danish Minister of Health that was passed in March , with the addition of allowing forced COVID-19 vaccinations as the Danish Health Authority can define \u201c who must be vaccinated to contain and eliminate a dangerous disease.\n\u201d Compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police assistance .\nBoth the Danish Medical Association and the Danish College of General Practitioners spoke

over 90 percent effective against the CCP virus by Moderna and Pfizer , and after an emergency authorization usage is granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Association \u2019 s ( FDA ) for the public , it will be a matter of time before more states and businesses may mandate Americans to get a vaccine .\n\u201c With polls showing that about half of Americans either do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine or have

were compared across groups ( Relative Incidence of Office Visit ( RIOV ) ) .\nRIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses .\nFull cohort , cumulative incidence analyses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matched for family history analyses were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake .\nIncreased office visits related to many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched analyses , family history , gender block , age block , and false discovery risk .\nMany outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care ( e.g.\n, anemia ( 6.334 ) , asthma ( 3.496 ) , allergic rhinitis ( 6.479 ) , and sinusitis ( 3.529 ) , all significant under the Z-test ) .\nDevelopmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family history of autoimmunity .\nRemarkably , zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study had attention deficit hyperactivity

developmental disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis testing , it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder ( 0.84 % ) in the cohort is half that of the US national rate ( 1.69 % ) .\nThe practice-wide rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate .\nThe data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated and

unreimbursed medical expenses .\nWhat is unclear is whether or not the program will pay for lifelong care .\nThe program does not award pain & suffering awards .\nIn the NVICP , this benefit can be awarded up to max of $ 250,000 .\nThe program does not provide reimbursement for legal representation or medical expert fees .\nThe vast majority of us will not be able to afford these fees , generally ranging between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NVICP to $ 250,000 and up for more complex and protracted cases .\nI wrote about the CICP last month , \u201c Why injuries suffered from the COVID-19 vaccines need to be litigated in the NVICP .\n\u201d But what happens to anyone that is injured from a COVID vaccine ?\nTheir options seeking compensation are extremely limited .\nThe CounterMeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) is your only option .\nIt is not equitable , not efficient from the petitioner \u2019 s point of view , and it is not fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCurrently 8 % of all petitioners since 2010 have been awarded compensation .\nIt has been said , \u201c the CICP is a program where you have the right to file and loose.\n\u201d And we are starting to read a growing number of medical organizations are saying no .\nSame for first responders .\nNo one is defending our seniors .\nAnd that is a tragedy .\nThe COVID vaccine is on track to be released first to a designated group of health care workers and residents of senior living facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes available , then high-risk candidates due to their medical condition , and finally the general public .\nThis might take 6 months or longer .\nI want to discuss how our Government is setting up the existing compensation programs for vaccine injury to fail , thus denying any type of future compensation for those who are injured because of the COVID vaccine and possible future new vaccines .\nI am not going to talk about the science of the vaccines .\nThat is being discussed so many other places .\nThat phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios .\nBut one of the most extreme and dangerous scenarios is being played out right now .\nHow our Government is plowing full speed ahead without any concern for the collateral damage it will cause in its quest to provide a COVID vaccine .\nIn the CICP , there is no trust fund established by a levy or tax on the countermeasure .\nJust appropriations by Congress that are not public information .\nIn the NVICP , you can appeal to a higher court .\nIn the CICP , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sec \u2019 y of HHS to reconsider the decision .\nYou are asking the same department who denied your claim initially to reconsider .\nSounds fair .\nAnd one of the most hideous elements of the CICP is this .\nThey are the payer of last resort .\nWhat that means , they will wait to see any private insurance coverage or life insurance pays first , then Medicaid/Medicare and Social Security disability , then the CICP .\nSo , if your loved one dies because of a countermeasure device , medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate receives a compensable decision of $ 250,000 in death benefits .\nThe estate receives a check for that amount , correct ?\nWrong .\nPrivate life insurance pays first , say $ 200,000 .\nThe check received would be only $ 50,000 or less if there are other benefits awarded to the deceased before CICP pays .\nHRSA is the administrator of the program .\nAnd they are very foggy with their answers to questions regarding types of awards .\nI have been filing FOIA \u2019 s for over 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information redacted .\nThey have refused .\nHiding behind the answer that the CICP is an administrative function , not a judicial legal proceeding .\nThus , they are not required to provide to the public this information .\nWhen asked in the recent ACCV meeting about funding , the representative provided an answer of \u201c funding for future COVID petitions has already been appropriated by Congress.\n\u201d The CARES Act ( passed March 27 2020 ) allocated money .\nSo , they knew they would be paying out damage awards before any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced and other COVID related countermeasures were approved .\nWhen asked if there were any petitions already received for COVID , the answer was yes .\nBut not for the vaccine , but rather for other countermeasures used to provide care for patients .\nWhen pressed for more specifics , the answer is \u201c we are working with the HRSA FOIA office to determine what information can be provided.\n\u201d I have received that answer for the last 8 years .\nIt appears that Sec \u2019 y of HHS and HRSA will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Government is spending a lot of time and effort to convince the public that the COVID vaccines are safe .\nWe have past presidents lining up to receive the vaccine .\nReminds me of when President Gerald Ford received a Swine Flu vaccine in the Oval Office back in the fall of 1976 .\nAnd we all know the disaster of that experimental vaccine and the embarrassment of the disclosure the CDC lied to Congress , to the President and worst of all , the American public .\nIf they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why don \u2019 t they disclose what is actually happening with injuries ?\nBy keeping it in the dark , the public will think it is safe .\nAnd then news of injures will eventually come out and public confidence will nosedive .\nAnd now we are seeing media and our government diverting discussion of vaccine safety by calling it \u201c misinformation.\n\u201d Another question posed to the HRSA representative today was asking about whether or not the CICP information will be printed on the VIS statement .\nYou will not believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined.\n\u201d No public awareness for those who are injured by a countermeasure .\nKeeps things tidy , don \u2019 t you think ?\nAnd another ongoing effort by the Sec \u2019 y of HHS is to strip Section 17 out of the NVICP .\nThis section deals with the allowing the CDC and other scientific communities to decide which vaccines should be added to the Vaccine Program .\nIf ACIP approves a vaccine for routine administration , The Secretary shall add the vaccine to the NVICP within 2 years .\nWithout Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any compensable mechanism afforded to them for injuries .\nIn March 2020 , the Sec \u2019 y of HHS quietly issues a NPRM to modify the Injury Table of the Vaccine Program to remove SIRVA ( shoulder injury ) and Syncope ( fainting ) .\nThe ACCV , in May , voted unanimously to reject the Secretary \u2019 s proposal .\nWhile the nation was so consumed with COVID , was this a chance to take advantage of the distraction ?\nAt the time , maybe .\nBut then in July the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts and forwards another NPRM to remove SIRVA , Syncope and Section 17 .\nIncluded is a hard deadline for all public comment set for January 12 , 2021 .\nMichael Milmoe , former DOJ attorney representing Sec \u2019 y of HHS since the beginning of the Program , and now representing injured clients , stated in his testimony in the ACCV meeting , \u201c In the entire 34 year history of the Program the Secretary has never moved forward with changes to the Table without first obtaining the approval , the buy-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until now.\n\u201d If the Sec \u2019 y of HHS is successful in adding this rule , then it is conceivable that any new vaccines approved by the CDC will have injury petitions adjudicated in the CICP where the public is not allowed to review and see how their tax dollars are spent .\nMilmoe continues \u201c If at the end of the day , the scientists recommend that COVID-19 vaccines be recommended for routine use in children , all COVID-19 cases should be covered by the Vaccine Program .\nNot the CICP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole discretion to make that decision , and from a scientific and policy standpoint , that is very unwise.\n\u201d Imagine if several other childhood vaccine injuries being removed from The Program and forcing parents to fight it out in the CounterMeasures Injury Compensation Program .\nI believe that this is a real possibility .\nAnd a possibility that is gaining steam and extremely difficult to stop .\nWayne Rohde , author of The Vaccine Court-The Dark Truth of America \u2019 s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and The Vaccine Court 2.0 ( @

Vaccination Law in Denmark Reportedly Dropped After Widespread Protests ( SEE VIDEOS ) With a COVID-19 vaccine possibly rolling out to the public by December or early next year , some governments are pushing for a mandatory vaccine program , as in Denmark where it was met with protests .\nThe national government in Denmark had to abandon a new law that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens took to the streets to protest by banging on pots and pans against an updated Epidemic Act ( pdf ) that gave the government an unprecedented amount of power to implement rules and extreme measures to fight against the CCP ( Chinese Communist Party ) virus pandemic .\nThe new Epidemic Act would replace the temporary amended law ( pdf ) that was unanimously and quickly passed back on March 12 in response to the pandemic .\nAt that time , one of the major revisions made involved transferring all the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to the Danish Minister of Health to allow for a quicker response to COVID-19 .\nBut this gave a lot of power to the minister of health who is able to \u201c access a person \u2019 s home with the police assistance without prior court order , \u201d and \u201c use police assistance to isolate , examine or treat a person who is infected or believed to be infected with one of the communicable diseases listed in the appendix to the Act , \u201d according to a blog by Janne Rothmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copenhagen .\nThe minister of health through a Ministerial Order was also able to limit the gathering of more than 10 people at indoor or outdoor public spaces except for \u201c political meetings/protests , supermarkets , and places of work , etc.\n\u201d The new Act would continue keeping the centralized powers with the Danish Minister of Health that was passed in March , with the addition of allowing forced COVID-19 vaccinations as the Danish Health Authority can define \u201c who must be vaccinated to contain and eliminate a dangerous disease.\n\u201d

vaccinations failed to illicit a sufficient level of herd immunity to keep the public safe\u2026 .\nIn Israel , the Health Minister is considering a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine law to @ @ @ @ @ @ @

businesses may mandate Americans to get a vaccine .\n\u201c With polls showing that about half of Americans either do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine or have reservations about getting vaccinated , there will be those who want societal sanctions to be levied against those who refuse to take it , \u201d Barbara Loe Fisher , Co-Founder and President of the National Vaccine Information Center , told The Epoch

kinds of data , including ( but not limited to ) , genealogy , disease patterns , heritability patterns , DNA markers , gene expression , etc .\nBig research grant funds flow liberally to researchers with access to unique archives of such big data .\nIn the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted in public or private universities , \u201c big data \u201d is deployed in the service of multiple

\u201c large population-based disease surveillance \u201d .\nAll the medical data being collected must go somewhere , and it does , into databases all over the world .\nWith \u201c big data \u201d

over the world have turned their focus to data as a source of competitive advantage .\nBut some of the biggest participants in the ecosystem of \u201c big data \u201d are large universities involved in medical , pharmaceutical , and biochemical research .\nThese universities typically represent their primary mission as educational : to teach , train and prepare their students for productive careers as scientists and physicians .\nIncreasingly , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mission altogether : applying for grants , conducting basic and applied research , pursuing medical innovation , and ultimately securing patents for commercially valuable ideas , which they can then turn around and license for huge returns .\nIf you thought universities paid their bills exclusively through tuition and alumni giving , think again .\nIncreasingly , these universities participate in a different kind of industry , one best described as \u201c big research.\n\u201d These government and private data efforts have become an industry of its own .\nThat industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we will call it \u201c big data \u201d .\nThis industry has many components , the keys to which are

exemplified than the government run University of Utah \u2019 s ( University ) , Utah Population Database ( UPDB ) , which is housed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( HERE ) The University proudly claims the UPDB \u201c is one of the world \u2019 s richest sources of in-depth information that supports research on genetics , epidemiology , demography , and public health \u2026 \u201d Since the mid- 1970s researchers \u201c \u2026have used UPDB to identify and study individuals and families that have higher than normal incidence of cancer or other diseases , to analyze patterns of genetic inheritance ,

( birth , marriage , or death ) in Utah they are selected for inclusion .\nIn other words , LDS or not , multigeneration pedigrees are being used as a resource for \u201c biomedical researchers.\n\u201d Many may ask why the LDS Church has been historically collecting multigeneration pedigrees .\nThe answer goes to the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the practice of conducting baptisms for the dead .\nMost outsiders to the faith have never heard of the baptism of the dead , but for an LDS church member it is a sacred obligation to their forebears and one of the core benefits joining the LDS church provides .\nTheir first prophet and founder , Joseph Smith , in 1840 revealed to the Saints that they \u201c could now act for their friends who had departed this life \u201d by being baptized in their behalf .\nIn other words , baptism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save all those who had died and were posthumously willing to obey the requirements of the law .\n( HERE ) Faithful members are encouraged to submit to the LDS Church the names , birthdates , birthplace , etc .\nof all family members , friends , alive or dead , LDS or not .\nBaptisms for the dead could then be conducted in LDS temples for deceased relatives along with other ordinances such as priesthood ordinations and marriage sealings .\nPracticing LDS church members are keenly aware that personal data submissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temple ordinations .\nNon-members , however , are likely unaware of an LDS relative \u2019 s submission of personally identifiable information for inclusion in LDS genealogy databases that can be used in unrestricted fashion by the LDS church after they die .\nFurther than this , neither members nor non-members likely are aware of the LDS church \u2019 s participation in the sharing of identifiable pedigrees as a resource for biomedical research profiling at the University without their consent or knowledge .\nIn a privacy notice posted on the LDS website ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they collect personal data from third parties .\nThe LDS Church further discloses that `` We may also use your personal data for internal purposes , including auditing , data analysis , system troubleshooting , and research .\nIn these cases , we base our processing on legitimate interests in performing the activities of the Church.\n\u201d No mention can be found of use of personal data

police type surveillance system .\nAs one opinion piece by Ron Mortensen stated , \u201c Rather than questioning the privacy issues raised by Banjo , cities , counties , police departments and the University of Utah embraced it with open arms .\nOf course , none of these entities ever informed the public of what they were doing.\n\u201d ( HERE ) .\nThe contract with Banjo was only recently temporarily halted when the founder was found to be affiliated with hate groups as a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Utah government officials promote apps to track citizens ' symptoms and contact information related to the COVID-19 pandemic .\nHERE .\nStudents at one private LDS university , Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , are rightly raising questions about whether Utah government will protect their personal health information amidst this pandemic .\nA recent news article in the BYU student newspaper , the Daily Universe states.\n, \u201c Personal health information ( PHI ) and personally identifiable information ( PII ) are protected by privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HERE ) , the Utah Communicable Disease Control Act ( HERE ) , and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Acts ( FERPA ) .\n( HERE ) .\nPublic health professionals and privacy law specialists agree there is a fine balance between sharing people \u2019 s private health information and protecting the health of the public.\n\u201d ( HERE ) .\nLikely these students have no idea that the LDS church in conjunction with the Utah Department of Health ( UDOH ) , and the University UPDB , for years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s identifiable private health information .\nHow do we know this has been happening ?\nOne of us , Zimmerman , is the Utah Autism Whistleblower .\nIn 2002 , while working at the UDOH , Zimmerman was asked by her supervisor to author and submit a grant proposal to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( CDC ) Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ( ADDM ) Network .\nThe health department was extremely interested in this federal funding for multiple reasons .\nPublic and private health clinics in Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children with autism .\nIf the UDOH could monitor the number and characteristics individuals with autism , the data then could be used to inform public policy decisions , plan for related services , improve community awareness , increase access to early screening , and perhaps paramount , the data could be used to study the causes , prevention , and outcomes related to autism .\nFortunately , Zimmerman \u2019 s proposal was approved , funded , and entitled , the Utah Registry of Autism and Developmental Disabilities ( URADD ) otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism and Developmental Monitoring Network .\nThe CDC awarded the grants through a competitive process usually for a four-year grant cycle .\nSites funded drastically changed overtime as well as sites with and without access to both school and health data .\nChanges in site selection and failure of some sites to have access to school records has directly impacted the CDC \u2019 s ability to make cross study year comparisons , a primary goal of the ADDM Network .\nIt is important to understand how the CDC ADDM Network determines autism rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the conflict in which the Utah Autism Whistleblower became embroiled .\nData sources are queried using ICD-9 diagnostic codes and special education classifications .\nAbstractors then go into the field to a review and gather extremely sensitive , identifiable , and detailed information on each child .\nInformation collected includes such things as race , birth dates , addresses , schools , providers seen by type , diagnostic codes , educational classifications , intellectual ability indicators , test scores , as well as detailed word for word behavioral descriptions .\nExperts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the individual meets the ADDM Network \u2019 s classification as an autism case .\nBy virtue of its wide scope , the identifiable data is both highly sensitive to subjects and highly valuable to researchers .\nThe ADDM Network , thus has strict data confidential and security policies required for a site and their staff \u2019 s participation ( HERE ) .\nAdditionally , staff are required to receive policy training and sign agreements that they will respect data security and privacy provisions ( HERE ) All data sources , including individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and public health entity administrators are given copies of the CDC data confidentiality and security policies that will be followed .\nWith this background in mind , Zimmerman ( who had run the privacy approval gauntlet in order to get URADD funded ) , in 2005 , sought and obtained approval to move the CDC URADD grant and related activities to the University .\nThere were many reasons for her to do this .\nFor one , the Utah state legislature had drastically reduced retirement benefits , including at UDOH , affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already contracted with and provided funding to several University researchers to assist her in URADD CDC grant activities including researchers Drs .\nWilliam McMahon , Judith Miller , and Deborah Bilder .\nMcMahon by that time was the current head of the Autism Research Program within the University Department of Psychiatry , had been involved in the early prevalence and genetic research studies led by Ritvo , and continued working actively in the field of autism/genetics research .\nMcMahon saw the grant as a valuable commodity , especially the extensive databases that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively recruiting Zimmerman since 2003 .\nZimmerman believed she had established a good working relationship with these researchers .\nIt seemed to her at the time as if the University offered a more stimulating environment in which to extract insights and lessons for public health .\nMcMahon and the UDOH committed to Zimmerman that she would remain in the role as the CDC URADD grant principle investigator ( PI ) and URADD Director , would receive state carryover funding if needed , and would be allowed to submit CDC grant proposals as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they became available .\nIt seemed like a match made in heaven , so Zimmerman made the choice to accept McMahon \u2019 s offer with endorsements from the UDOH , under whose health authority health data was collected , and the CDC .\nMCMAHON MOVES TO TAKE OVER THE URADD CDC GRANT DATABASE Shortly after moving to the U of U a more sinister side of McMahon began to emerge as he immediately began breaching promises made to Zimmerman .\nMost outrageous of all these breaches was his move to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the world of research , it is usual and customary for the person listed on grant application as PI , sole author , and signatory with the funding agency , in this case Zimmerman \u2019 s agreement with the CDC , to have the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval for the grant that was awarded under their name .\nInstead , McMahon insisted his name be substituted for hers on the IRB and designated himself there as the PI .\nSimultaneously McMahon began claiming to colleagues inside and outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that \u201c URADD was his grant.\n\u201d ( HERE ) .\nFrom the outset of Zimmerman \u2019 s arrival at the U in 2005 , she felt that McMahon was showing himself as someone who would abuse his authority as an administrator for personal gain , and she believed , would readily plagiarize , and steal someone else \u2019 s work in order to gain access to hundreds of thousands of identifiable school and health CDC ADDM grant records .\nWhy would McMahon be motivated to do this ?\nFirst , McMahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Psychiatry .\nBy promoting himself as the PI on a large , prestigious , federal grant his professional reputation and resume would be enhanced and his candidacy for chairmanship improved .\nIndeed in 2007 , McMahon was successful in his bid to become chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University when Doctor Bernard Grosser stepped down after 29 years as chairman .\nMcMahon was appointed as the next chairman .\nBy 2012 , Grosser had left the University in disgrace and surrendered his medical license for an \u201c inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERE Second and equally important , McMahon wanted to take over the rich trove of identifiable autism data to use as a resource for his personal research and business interests avoiding any oversite by Zimmerman .\nMcMahon was eager for the glory of discovering the gene ( or genes ) that cause autism .\nIndeed , he was already preparing to file a patent titled \u201c Autism associated genetic markers \u201d , with a genomics company aptly named Lineagen ( HERE ) , the provisional version of which was submitted in November 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination by the patent office , that application was eventually abandoned ) .\nAt the time , the great autism gene hunt was in full swing and McMahon saw himself at the leading edge of what he hoped were commercially valuable insights .\nLastly , McMahon could use these hundreds of thousands of identifiable records as leverage for maintaining his power and position in the University administration while currying favor with his new boss , Dr. Vivian Lee .\nLee joined the university in 2011 as the senior Vice President for Health Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CEO of University of Utah Health .\nA graduate of Harvard-Radcliffe and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford , Lee came to the University with a reputation as a hard-nosed , ambitious administrator of big research operations , one who had little patience for poor financial performance .\nLee and McMahon seemed to get off to a bad start .\nLee had begun making major organizational changes in the health sciences arena .\nThe Department of Psychiatry that McMahon led was by 2011 in severe financial crisis .\nMany junior and senior researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud often voicing complaints to Lee on their way out .\nAll but three autism faculty researchers , Drs .\nAmanda Bakian , Deborah Bilder , and Hilary Coon , would or had already left the Department .\nTo top it off , Medicaid had fined a psychiatry staffed clinic , the Neurobehavior HOME Program , approximately 2 million dollars related to overbilling .\nBy 2012 Lee became so concerned about the Department of Psychiatry under McMahon \u2019 s leadership , she engaged an outside consulting company to conduct an in-depth review and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir report included harsh criticisms of McMahon \u2019 s leadership .\nWith financial obligations looming , McMahon was under pressure from his boss , Lee , to produce and implement recommendations from the unfavorable audit .\nThe URADD CDC grant that Zimmerman had brought with her was one of only a few high-profile , multimillion-dollar , departmental grants .\nMcMahon needed money to meet his shortfalls and started putting pressure on Zimmerman , by making what she saw as illegal and unreasonable demands to use earmarked federal grant dollars to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also started cutting corners in other areas.\n, He told junior faculty that neither a research IRB was needed nor was URADD oversite research committee approval required for use of URADD CDC grant data , and that researchers \u201c need not follow the signed CDC data confidentiality and security agreements \u201d to which Zimmerman had committed for their participation in the CDC URADD CDC activities .\nTwo researchers readily went along with McMahon \u2019 s quest for short cuts , Bakian and Bilder .\nOthers did not .\nBy the summer of 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to account for grant related dollars for which she was responsible .\nMoreover , Zimmerman had reason to believe Bakian had stolen identifiable CDC URADD grant data from a restrictive use server for research with McMahon and Bilder .\nZimmerman believed these actions likely violated federal privacy laws and violated signed CDC data confidentiality and security agreements .\nIf verifiable this meant McMahon had orchestrate a symphony of offenses : University commitments to data sources had been violated ; University commitments to parents had been violated ; University commitments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been violated .\nYet despite the blatant disregard for research ethics , when Zimmerman began to voice her concerns , University administrators ignored her and no one on the outside seemed to care , including the CDC , the UDOH , and the Utah Attorney General \u2019 s Office .\nBig research has incentives to look the other way when big data can bring in valuable grants Zimmerman went to multiple University administrators for help including Lee and University attorney Phyllis Vetter .\nFive key messages emerged from her outreach efforts to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 None If you keep asking for legal clarification , we will fire you .\n\u2022 None We will not help you unless you agree to share identifiable grant data with researchers \u2022 None The University owns the data and can do what the University wants with it .\n\u2022 None No one will help you if you keep trying to comply with the privacy agreements that you personally signed .\nNot surprisingly , McMahon readily agreed to share identifiable data with his small cadre of research cronies .\nIn the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way and began working with University attorney Scott Smith to get her fired .\nBeyond the obstacles to big data access Zimmerman was putting up , McMahon had little basis for his action .\nZimmerman had passed a rigorous Review , Promotion and Tenure process in 2012 ( HERE ) , just prior to this .\nMcMahon and Smith did not care as they forged ahead with their termination process .\nZimmerman was eventually fired a few months later .\nLee , had no direct fingerprints on Zimmerman \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee was supportive .\nShe was an aggressive proponent of expanding the University \u2019 s use of big data and in September 2012 had convened a University wide strategic retreat , \u201c Defining the Roles for the Utah Population Database.\n\u201d ( HERE ) .\nLee \u2019 s goals were made clear at the retreat , to get more case data for the UPDB anywhere and anyway they could and that included merging the URADD CDC grant database with the UPDB .\nOver the next several years Lee continued her quest for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s big research activities and big data assets .\nIn a bold move that generated national headlines , Lee fired Dr. Mary Beckerle , the HCI Director and CEO by email in 2017 .\nWith that firing , Lee gained total control over the UPDB and the entire funding of the HCI .\nBeckerle \u2019 s firing was short lived , however , and the University never really disclosed all the reasons why Berkerle had been so abruptly fired in the first place .\nMany suspected it was because Beckerle raised concerns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been diverted by Lee ( HERE ) .\nOne key donor had been integral to the massive data collection efforts and cancer research funding in Utah , Jon Huntsman , Sr. Huntsman , a prominent Utah LDS businessman was reported to have donated over $ 1.4 billion to cancer research that created the Salt Lake City-based HCI at the University where the UPDB is housed .\n( HERE ) .\nHuntsman Sr , immediately pushed back on Lee \u2019 s hardball tactics , coming quickly and decisively to the defense of Beckerle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her firing wasn \u2019 t reversed .\nHuntsman Sr. then went on to pay for full page ads in a one of the largest newspapers in Utah , the Tribune .\nIt just so happened the Huntsman family owned the Tribune at the time .\nHuntsman publicly humiliated Lee , attributing Beckerle \u2019 s firing to a \u201c power grab by an unethical and dishonest Vivian Lee \u201d ( HERE ) With Huntsman \u2019 s backing , Beckerle was reinstated and Lee resigned her post as the CEO of the University Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huntsman family , to date , continues to financially support the University \u2019 s UPDB and HCI .\n( HERE ) At least publicly , the family seems unconcerned that \u201c People aren \u2019 t notified in advance when their health records or other personal information are sent to the database-but anyone born in Utah or who has been treated for a health issue while living here , or has had common interactions with state government , such as voting or registering a marriage is , likely included.\n\u201d Since Jon Huntman \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 , the Huntsman \u2019 s family continues to make large donations to the University , including a $ 150 million dollar contribution to establish the Huntsman Mental Health Institute ( HERE ) , which includes the Department of Psychiatry , where Zimmerman formerly worked and was fired after reporting privacy concerns and other illegal activities .\nMuch could be written about what has happened at the University since Zimmerman \u2019 s firing in 2012 .\nA very brief synopsis is as follows .\nMcMahon , Bilder , and Bakian were successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URADD CDC grant data for their research purposes and replaced Zimmerman in all CDC ADDM Network activities .\nTheir research activities and , in Zimmerman \u2019 s view misconduct , continue .\nTwo years before Lee \u2019 s resignation , McMahon called it quits and stepped down as department chairman for reasons that were never made clear .\nMcMahon was granted \u201c emeritus \u201d status at the University and maintains a role as University community liaison on autism related issues .\nThe Utah AGO continues to rigorously defend actions of the University including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education records with researchers without parental consent or knowledge and continues to oppose free speech protections for government employees and University faculty under the Utah Constitution .\nFor the last seven years , Zimmerman \u2019 s legal claims ( there are a number and are summarized HERE ) have been slowly working their way through multiple court jurisdictions , including federal U.S. District Court , the Utah Supreme Court , and Utah State Court .\nDespite numerous objections from the Utah AGO , The Utah Supreme Court ruled that Zimmerman \u2019 s whistleblower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employee Protection Act and could move forward .\nThe Utah Supreme Court did not render a decision on Zimmerman \u2019 s free speech claim under the Utah constitution , however U.S. District Court judge Parrish later dismissed the claim .\n( HERE ) .\nIn U.S. District court , Zimmerman prevailed on her whistleblower claim and was awarded damages .\n( HERE ) Other Utah State Court claims are still in process .\nThe Utah AGO was successful in moving Zimmerman \u2019 s breach of contract claim filed in federal court over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue , Zimmerman has been able to gather further evidence indicative of research misconduct by McMahon , Bilder , and Bakian .\nZimmerman now has forensic evidence showing McMahon , Bilder .\nand Bakian used a forged data sharing agreement to justify accessing identifiable URADD CDC grant data for research purposes .\n( HERE ) without Zimmerman \u2019 s knowledge or approval .\nEvidence also shows massive data errors and omissions in the URADD CDC database made by Bakian , were known to the CDC and McMahon , yet not corrected .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Utah \u2019 s \u201c big data \u201d efforts ?\nLike it or not \u201c big data \u201d is here to stay .\nThese large datasets are highly sought after by researchers particularly for the procurement of grant funding .\nThe CDC ADDM Network is no exception .\nThe Network had important autism surveillance goals , clear methodological procedures , and detailed data confidentiality and security policies in place .\nDespite all that , the University , the Utah Attorney General Office , the UDOH , and the CDC were all willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies on the back shelf when violations were reported .\nLegal or not ?\nCertainly , on face value , research misconduct including intentional falsification of research findings and the forging of documents would be illegal .\nWe may never know for sure .\nUntil such a time as there is government accountability and transparency in the \u201c big data \u201d arena mistrust in government will continue to grow and , in our view , justifiably so

we can blame President Trump .\nAnd in a month we can blame President Biden .\nTwo pawns in a game I simply do not understand .\nBy Anne Dachel Introduction : From WHYY in Philadelphia , I \u2019 m Terry Gross with Fresh Air .\nToday we talk about the new vaccines that will hopefully get the pandemic under control .\nWe \u2019 ll also talk about the anti-vaxxer movement which is getting international traction and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated .\nI \u2019 ll speak with Dr. Peter Hotez , co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children \u2019 s Hospital and dean of the National School of Topical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston .\nHe \u2019 s part of a team working on developing a COVID vaccine .\nHe became the target of anti-vaxxers years ago when he started debunking beliefs that vaccines cause autism .\nHis daughter was diagnosed with autism in 1994 when she was 19 months old .\nHotez is the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandemic , Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti-Science .\nThe new coronavirus vaccines are giving us hope that we can get the virus under control .\nPfizer and Moderna have announced that their vaccines are showing very promising results , and this week a third company , AztraZeneca , announced that the vaccine it \u2019 s developed had good results in its late stage clinical trials .\nBut for the vaccines to work , people have to be willing to get vaccinated .\nMy guest , Dr. Peter Hotez , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the development of one for COVID 19 , and he \u2019 s very well-acquainted with the anti-vaxxer movement .\n\u2026 Much of his career has been devoted to developing vaccines for neglected , poverty-related tropical diseases .\nTexas , where he lives , is the epicenter of rare topical diseases in the U.S\u2026 .\nWhen a research paper came out that was later discredited connecting vaccines to autism , galvanizing the anti-vaxxer movement , he tried to debunk it .\nThat made him a target of the movement .\nHe wrote about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Not Cause Rachel \u2019 s Autism\u2014My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist , Pediatrician and Autism Dad .\nRegarding the choice of which of the 3 vaccine we \u2019 ll be getting : Dr. Hotez : I think at least in the beginning we \u2019 re not going to have much choice , but that \u2019 s okay because they all work pretty much by the same pathway .\nThey all work by inducing an immune response to the spike protein of the virus and they \u2019 re just different technology approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I \u2019 m asked all the time is \u201c Hey doc , which vaccine are you waiting for ?\n\u201d And the answer is , I \u2019 m not .\nThey all work by inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein .\nThat \u2019 s the best way we know to prevent us , if we \u2019 re exposed to the virus , from going into the hospital or the ICU .\nI \u2019 m going to take any of those vaccines that \u2019 s made available to me , that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Administration .\nLater on , if it turns out that the length of protection is not so long or if there \u2019 s better vaccines coming along , it \u2019 s okay .\nWe can always get a boost later on .\nBut don \u2019 t over think it .\nDon \u2019 t wait .\nGet what vaccine you can because they all work by inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies into your system .\nTerry Gross : I don \u2019 t really understand how the new vaccines can predict their effectiveness .\nFor example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand it , for AstraZeneca and Pfizer , they gave people vaccines .\nThere was a control group that didn \u2019 t get vaccines , and then everybody \u2019 s told basically , go about your business , live like you \u2019 ve been living and then we \u2019 ll see who gets the virus and whether the virus is severe when you get it .\nYou can \u2019 t very well intentionally expose them to COVID .\nThat would not only be unethical , it would be incredibly dangerous .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in the study .\nBut if you \u2019 re telling people just like , live your life and we \u2019 ll see what happens , well , everybody \u2019 s exposed to different things in their life so there isn \u2019 t consistency , there isn \u2019 t like a control of what like you \u2019 re exposed to .\nHow can you really tell how effective the vaccine is ?\nHotez : Well , thinking behind these large clinical trials\u2014and we \u2019 ve got a lot of experience with this\u2014is these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine is being tested on 44,000 individuals , it \u2019 s almost like a small city .\nSo that yes , some people will change their behavior because they either got the vaccine or placebo , they don \u2019 t know which one they got , others won \u2019 t , but it kind of evens out ultimately .\nAnd what happens is , my understanding is this looking at symptomatic infections so that if you start developing symptoms that you think could be COVID , you get tested and that then counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t subtle .\nIt looks like these vaccines provided very high level of protections , a 90 percent decrease or more in the cases .\nThat \u2019 s really exciting .\nGross : So you \u2019 re working on a vaccine .\nWhat does that mean exactly ?\nWhat is the work that you \u2019 re doing on it ?\nHotez : At our Texas Children \u2019 s Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine , we \u2019 ve been doing this now for two decades : developing low-cost global health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one else wants to take on because when they \u2019 re complicated often , but second they \u2019 re diseases that generally only affect the poorest of the poor .\nWe \u2019 ve made some progress in terms of shaping vaccines and getting them to clinical trials .\nBut then about a decade ago , we recognized coronaviruses were going to be of enormous pandemic potential , and at that time nobody was really very interested in coronavirus vaccines , so we adopted it .\nWe started partnering with the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Laboratory and Walter Reed .\nWe wrote an NIH grant that was funded , and we wound up developing vaccines for the first coronavirus pandemic potential , SARS or SARS 1 in 2003 that emerged out of southern China , and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome , MERS .\nWhen we saw the sequence of the SARS 2 coronavirus that causes COVID 19 , the Chinese scientist that put this up on a preprint server\u2026 , we realized that we could move pretty fast in terms of developing a third coronavirus vaccine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult circumstances , \u2026 They worked day and night under difficult circumstances because , if you remember , back in the spring , they weren \u2019 t allowing many businesses to be open .\nWe had special permission because we were working on COVID-19 .\nThey worked in record time and building on all of the experiences , the successes and failures that we had with the previous coronavirus vaccines to move pretty quickly , and now we signed an agreement with BioE or Biological E based in India\u2026and they are now scaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing it across India .\nIt \u2019 s very exciting for us to make a contribution .\nWe \u2019 ve never made a billion of anything before , so that \u2019 s pretty exciting also , but the point is this is a very traditional technology .\nThe same technology used to make the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine used all over the world .\nAnd that \u2019 s important for two reasons : ONE , many countries have the ability to make their own Hepatitis B vaccine , so that potentially our vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t depend on it being made in Europe or the U.S. , and then filtering to the low and middle income countries .\nAnd it could be made pretty inexpensively we think so that Hepatitis B vaccine in many cases is made for under a dollar a dose .\nWe think our vaccine could come along in a similar cost structure .\nGross : President Trump is taking credit for Project Warp Speed and for fast-tracking the vaccine research .\nI \u2019 m wondering how much credit you give him directly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC , NIH , NIAD .\nAnd maybe you could mention one or two of the things that you think he \u2019 s done wrong and done right .\nHotez : Well no question none of this would have happened without carefully thought out infrastructure by the National Institutes of Health and our fantastic research universities and institutes .\nThat made all of this possible .\nExactly how Operation Warp Speed was assembled , I don \u2019 t have a lot of details about that .\n\u2026 The only piece that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have liked to see more of is more of a communication strategy coming out of Operation Warp Speed .\nThe communications has been very much left to the pharma CEOs , and I think overall they \u2019 ve not done a good job communicating to the American people .\nFirst of all , too much reliance on press releases that over this past year have been sometimes hard to decipher or understand , too many leaked phone calls , too much weirdness about the stock trading and options .\nI think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to have seen government scientists out there communicating on a frequent regular basis about Operation Warp Speed , very much like the way Andrew Cuomo did in March and April .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to be every day , but on a regular basis .\nI \u2019 ve done what I can to fill in those gaps being on the various cable news networks and podcasts , but you know , at the end of the day , I \u2019 m not a government scientist .\nI \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I see it , but I don \u2019 t have the accountability as being a government scientist .\nGross : So you \u2019 ve spoken about how scientists from competing pharmaceutical companies and your own group are cooperating with each other , at least to some degree , sharing information for the greater good .\nPresident Trump on the other hand has been calling the virus , \u201c the China Virus , \u201d which is not in the spirit of cooperation .\nHe \u2019 s pulled out of the World Health Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of cooperation that you \u2019 re talking about .\nDo you think that has limited in any way what we or other countries are able to do in the development of a vaccine ?\nWhat are the problems that may have been caused by , for instance , pulling out of the World Health Organization ?\nHotez : I think the scientists are still sharing information and communicating at an international level .\nI don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s been too affected .\nThe thing that I worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaccines .\nIn fact , there \u2019 s a new term that \u2019 s been coined called \u201c v\u00e4xa nationalism \u201d where you talk about the Chinese vaccine , the Russian vaccine , the British vaccine , the American vaccine .\nWe \u2019 ve never had that before , and I think it \u2019 s counter-productive .\nAnd so by the U.S. pulling out of the World Health Organization and refusing to be a part of the COVAX sharing facility , which our new mechanism that \u2019 s been put in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this has been counter-productive and could hold us back .\nWe also now have this unfortunate situation where countries that don \u2019 t have full access to vaccines are now making one-off deals with the Russians , the Chinese and it has kind of a Cold War smell to it .\nWe have to fix that as well .\nI \u2019 ve devoted my whole life to this concept of vaccine diplomacy , sharing vaccine development practices between countries and I served that role as U.S. science envoy in the Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to that .\nGross : The CDC recently released new suggestions about mask wearing .\nWe had been told that wearing masks protects other people from you spreading the disease , from the mask wearer spreading the disease , but now we \u2019 re being told that \u2018 s it \u2019 s effective\u2014not terribly effective , but somewhat effective\u2014in protecting the person wearing the mask from other people who might be spreading the disease .\nWhat \u2019 s your understanding about how much wearing a mask can protect you against getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates now from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington really looking at the number of deaths that are going to be projected to result from COVID-19 , and they \u2019 re pretty chilling numbers It says unless we can get to 95 percent mask wearing , we \u2019 re looking at another 150,000 who will lose their lives between now and a week or two after the inauguration .\nWe have the stunning number in a terrible way of 400,000Americans losing their lives by a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s basically the number of American G.I.s who died in World War II .\nWe \u2019 re looking at those kinds of numbers .\nFor me the tragedy is none of those people have to die if we adhere to 95 percent mask wearing , number one .\nNumber two , social distancing , especially in times when there \u2019 s a threat of a big surge on intensive care units , because remember , that \u2019 s when the mortality figures go way up .\nWe saw this in New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southern Europe , in Italy and Spain in March and April .\nThe death rates really accelerate as ICU staffs start to get overwhelmed and that \u2019 s already starting to happen now in the northern Midwest , in Lubbock and El Paso , here in Texas .\nSo just by those straightforward measures , social distancing , being responsible , wearing masks , we can save tens of thousands of American lives between now and the time of the inauguration .\nAnd that has to be our big emphasis .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to explain to general audiences is , look , in the past when I \u2019 ve asked people to wear masks and do the social distancing , prevent the ICU surges , I never had a bracket on the right hand size .\nI was never able to say that , look in the past I \u2019 ve said , please do this and we \u2019 ll figure out something later , Now we have something concrete to say .\nWe have good vaccines coming .\nIf you can keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sister alive just for the next two , three months , we can start getting them vaccinated , and they will live a normal life span .\nThis is not a time to be reckless or careless or defiant or tying political allegiance to protesting COVID prevention measures .\nThis is a time to save the lives of your loved ones .\nIt \u2019 s been really exasperating when we \u2019 re seeing so many refuse to understand that straightforward point .\nGross : How soon do you think a vaccine will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now applying for emergency use authorization .\nIt \u2019 ll take two or three weeks for the FDA and the affiliated committees to review that information .\nAnd I think vaccine could\u2014we could start releasing vaccine to selected populations by the middle of December .\nRemember other vaccines are coming along .\nWe \u2019 ll have , following the Pfizer vaccine , the Moderna , the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine , in the U.S. we \u2019 ll have the J and J vaccine .\nSo that by the early part of next year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , in vaccinating a significant percentage of the population .\nOver the weekend , Moncef Slaoui , who heads Operation Warped Speed felt that we could reach herd immunity , meaning 70 percent of the U.S. population , through vaccines by as early as the spring .\nI think that \u2019 s a bit aspirational .\nI don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ll quite get there , but you get the idea .\n\u2026 Gross : So your advice is don \u2019 t see this as an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is make sure you survive long enough to get the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s a reason to protect yourself until a vaccine is ready .\nHotez : That \u2019 s right .\nIt \u2019 s especially tragic if one of your loved ones loses their life or has permanent , long-lasting injury during this period because it \u2019 s just a matter of staying disciplined for the next couple of months , getting them to the other side .\nWe get them vaccinated ; they can live a normal life This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is not a time to be reckless .\nThis is a time to take this virus seriously and realize now we have an end to this through vaccination .\nGross : And this is especially important advice during the holidays .\nDo you think people should like not go visit family and friends during Thanksgiving and Christmas as much as they want to ?\n\u2019 \u2019 Hotez : We all have to make some tough decisions .\nI know we like to be together .\nFamilies like to be together over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other holidays .\nThis may not be the year to do it with this much virus circulating in the country right now .\nRemember the U.S. is the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of new cases .\nAnd not only that , it \u2019 s even more defined than that .\nRight now it \u2019 s the middle part of the country , especially in the upper Midwest and in Texas .\nThese are the highest COVID transmission rates in the world .\nAnd what that means practically speaking is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , whether it \u2019 s in airports , or bus stations or train stations or any public venue , there \u2019 s going to be lots of COVID infected individuals there .\nThis is not a time to travel .\nThis is a time to prepare for future Thanksgivings and Christmases ahead by protesting your loved ones .\nGross : What are some of the things you \u2019 re hoping the Biden administration will do ?\nAnd I know that you think federal guidance to states , to governors , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something President Trump chose to do .\nWhy is that federal guidance important , and what kind of guidance are hoping the Biden administration provides ?\nHotez : I think one of the most important is actually leading a federally coordinated response .\nI think what we saw all this year in the Trump administration was putting the states in the lead and the U.S. government would be responsible for backup , supply chain management and FEMA support and manufacturing ventilators and that sort of thing .\nIt didn \u2019 t work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the world in terms of COBVID-19 deaths .\nAnd the reason it didn \u2019 t work is the states never had the epidemiologic horsepower even know how to conduct COVID control measures .\nThey also needed the political cover of the federal government to deflect from the attacks that they were getting from their own internal political opposition .\nI think that having a federally coordinated response which the Biden administration seems committed to will make a big difference .\nThe other thing that I \u2019 ve recommended is given how disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , particularly with Scott Atlas leading things and leading that aggressive disinformation campaign claiming that COVID-19 deaths were not due to COVID-19 but other causes or discrediting masks or fake concepts of herd immunity .\nI would say the leadership of the response needs to be taken out of Washington and put firmly in the control of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nMove it to Atlanta .\nThis is why the American people pay $ 11 billion a year in taxes to the CDC .\nPut them firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal deficiencies that have to be corrected because we did see mistakes in 2020 , missing the virus entry from Europe into New York , and the problem with the testing .\nFix that component , but put the CDC firmly in charge .\nI think it \u2019 s going to be really important .\nAnd finally , if we \u2019 re really going to achieve that 70 percent herd immunity , which is what our estimates came up with together with our colleagues at City University of New York , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ways to communicate about vaccines and the importance of vaccines and really start doing something about this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement that \u2019 s now morphed into a wide scale anti-science machine or empire or confederacy that really dominates the Internet and dominates our American life right now .\nWe \u2019 ve got to figure out a way to begin dismantling that as well .\nGross : Any suggestions of how to do that ?\nYou \u2019 ve been trying to debunk the claims of the anti-vaxxers for years .\nYou haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stronger than it ever was probably .\nHotez : That \u2019 s right .\nIt began , really took its modern form in 2015 under this fake slogans , health freedom , medical freedom and then expanded out of Texas , became a national movement headed by Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. who now publicly labels me the OG Villain because I wrote a book called , Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel \u2019 s Autism , explaining why vaccines don \u2019 t cause autism .\nBut then that national anti-vaccine movement then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It not only now protested against vaccines , but in 2020 it now protests against masks and social distancing and contact tracing .\nSo it \u2019 s done a lot of damage in terms of preventing COVID-19 prevention measures , especially in the middle part of the country .\nAnd we \u2019 ve even seen now it exported to Western Europe .\nSo we \u2019 ve had now rallies in Berlin , in London , in Paris .\nRFK , Jr spoke at the rally in Berlin , and CBS News and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QAnon , a neo-Nazi group .\nIt \u2019 s taken on this very dark turn , and as I say , it dominates the Internet with more than 480 fake anti-vaccine sites all revved up social media and ecommerce platforms .\nWe \u2019 re going to have to figure out a way to confront this .\nIt \u2019 s not enough just to fine tune our measure or promote pro-vaccine messages .\nI say it will get us about 30 or 40 percent of the way there because those messages are messages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to do something about the Atlantic Ocean and begin taking down the anti-vaccine empire and confederacy .\nGross : The rally in Berlin that you mentioned that Robert Kennedy , Jr. spoke at , that was a rally of like 18,000 people protesting COVID restrictions , including mask wearing , and apparently very few people in that 18,000 large rally , very few people were wearing masks .\nI know at one time that Kennedy opposed early vaccinations , believing that they were linked to autism , but I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-mask or anti-COVID restrictions leader .\nHotez : Here \u2019 s the interesting part about the anti-vaccine movement .\nWhen you saw COVID-19 emerge , my first thought was , well , maybe finally this is what puts the anti-vaccine groups sort of into retreat or somehow sets them back .\nI think that happened for about 2 weeks , and then they came out and really reenergized , and then took on all anti-COVID-19 measures like social distancing , again under this fake banner of health freedom or medical freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracies as well .\nYou have , you know , Bill Gates is trying to implant chips into people through vaccinations and links with 5G that I still don \u2019 t understand .\nOf course really going after the OG Villain , meaning me and going after Dr. Fauci .\nAnd that \u2019 s the other scary element of this .\nIt \u2019 s the targeting of scientists .\nSo this is yet another dimension .\nAnd then you have the fact that the Russians are using what \u2019 s sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with \u2026trolls and lots of anti-COVID prevention measures and anti-vaccine messages .\nThis has been reported on by U.S. and British intelligence .\nSo that \u2019 s a big concern .\nThe problem is

the victim , like you \u2019 re buying into conspiracy theories by saying Russia\u2026 Hotez : I think it \u2019 s real , and we \u2019 re going to have to figure out a way\u2014 And I think we \u2019 ve let it go so big because I think the attitude in the U.S. of the HHS agencies\u2014because I \u2019 ve had calls where they , you know , I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you , you know , writing about the anti-vaccine movement ?\nYou \u2019 re just going to give this oxygen and amplify their message.\n\u201d I \u2019 ve said , \u201c Look , that horse has left the barn .\nThat ship has sailed .\nThis is out there and it \u2019 s dominating the Internet.\n\u201d As I say , 480 fake anti-vaccine websites .\nIf you go to Amazon.com , you put books up at the top , as everyone \u2019 s done , press return , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left that says , health , fitness and diet .\nYou click that and then you get another scroll down menu that will allow you to select vaccinations .\nYou click that and it \u2019 s all fake anti-vaccine books .\nGross : Is there like a hidden agenda behind the anti-vaxxer movement ?\nIn a lot of movements , there \u2019 s money behind it , and the people with the money have a vested interest in promoting this cause for corporate reasons , for political reasons , for whatever reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement ?\nIs this a movement being led by people with some kind of motive that goes beyond COVID-19 ?\nHotez : Yeah , I don \u2019 t know that the anti-vaccine movement all speaks with one voice .\nThat \u2019 s why I call it more of a confederacy than anything else .\nAnd where exactly the money comes from\u2014 There \u2019 s a lot of money behind it and organization as well .\nIt really needs a good investigative journalist to really push hard on this .\nBut clearly in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme political right and traditional sources of funding for the political right , especially under this health freedom/medical/freedom banner .\nI think that \u2019 s a big piece to this .\nI think the other is the Russian government \u2019 s doing a piece of this .\nThe health and wellness industry and all the supplements , in some cases the fake autism cures .\nI think they \u2019 re helping to fund this as well .\nBut it really needs to be more carefully looked at , and unfortunately I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take that on with all the other things I have to do .\nI think this is going to be really important .\nAnd also I think if the U.S. government \u2019 s going to want to do something about this .\nNow it \u2019 s gotten to the point where it \u2019 s going to have to go beyond the Health and Human Services agencies .\nWe \u2019 re going to need an inter-government task force to really look at this , and the problem is no one really wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know the reasons they don \u2019 t want to take it on .\nI think clearly they see how I get beat up for it , and nobody wants to step into that too quickly .\nAnd it \u2019 s complicated and it \u2019 s a hard slog , and there are other priorities I think people feel .\nI think it \u2019 s going to be very important .\nGross : So you \u2019 ve been a target basically since the anti-vax movement started because your daughter was diagnosed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a research study that was debunked that said that childhood vaccines or infant vaccines could lead to autism .\nLike I said , that study was debunked , but the belief lingered on that there was a connection .\nYou tried to debunk that belief , which made you a target of the anti-vaxxer movement .\nHave the threats changed ?\nBecause you \u2019 ve been a target of threats since the early days , have the threats and the number of threats changed recently because of COVID ?\nHotez : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , but also because I \u2019 ve been working on for 10 years .\nI have a much higher media profile on the cable news networks than I \u2019 ve had before .\nSo that revved up the intensity in terms of the emails and the stuff you see on Twitter and other forms of social media .\nSo probably the volume and the amplitude has definitely accelerated over the last year .\nAnd these groups have been targeting several scientists as well as people like Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of what \u2019 s been going on .\nGross : Oh , it \u2019 s really dark .\nTo think that scientists like you and Dr. Fauci are being the targets of threats .\nIt \u2019 s just horrifying .\nIt \u2019 s just so wrong and so shocking that that would be happening , but we all know that it \u2019 s happening .\nSo you got involved with this because your daughter was diagnosed with autism when she was 19 months old .\nWhy didn \u2019 t you believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Just seeing Rachel and her behavior and her developmental delays .\nIt \u2019 s such a pervasive situation in terms of her capabilities .\nIn fact they used to call it pervasive developmental disorder , which was an appropriate term , I thought , , for many forms of autism .\nI couldn \u2019 t imagine a plausible mechanism as an MD/PHD physician/scientist , pediatrician./scientist .\nI couldn \u2019 t envision a plausible mechanism by inducing an immune response to a virus that could account for how global the deficits and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental disorder or autism .\nIt just didn \u2019 t make any sense to me .\nSo it always sounded odd from the beginning .\nAnd then what you saw was the anti-vaccine people kept on moving the goal posts as the scientific community debunked the links .\nSo the first link to be debunked was the links between MMR vaccine and autism .\nAnd that was the original assertion from Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues in London , that it was the MMR vaccine .\nAnd then they pivoted .\nThey said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMR vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccines .\nAnd then it pivoted again to spacing vaccines too close together , and then it was aluminum in vaccines .\nAnd you realized that there was no science here .\nIt was all a different type of agenda to try and stay relevant , and that still continues today .\nI \u2019 d like to think I \u2019 ve done a pretty good job debunking the autism/vaccine links .\nNow you \u2019 re starting to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re calling it unspecified chronic illnesses .\nAnd how do you start going after that ?\nGross : Now that we have several vaccines in the works for COVID , do you feel like you can see an end in sight to the pandemic ?\nWhen you look ahead , what do you see say , in the next year ?\nHotez : I think in the next year we \u2019 re going to have at least maybe half a dozen vaccines , maybe more .\nI hope ours is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on our way to vaccinating the U.S. population and Europe and Japan .\nI don \u2019 t know about the low and middle income countries , how successful we \u2019 ll be , and that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re trying to come in with our low-cost vaccine .\nBut clearly we \u2019 ll make a big dent in this particular pandemic , although it may take us a couple of years to vaccinate our way out of it .\nThe other problem that I see is this will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had SARS in 2003 .\nWe \u2019 ve had MERS in 2012 .\nNow we have COVID-19 .\nIt \u2019 s just a matter of before we have COVID-26 or COVID-29 or COVID 32 .\nThis is going to be a regular occurrence .\nSo now we \u2019 re looking at the prospect of developing a universal coronavirus vaccine because I think there is going to be an important need there .\nGross : But what do you see when you look ahead in terms of our ability to resume something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s not going to be a light switch .\nIt \u2019 s going to be an evolving process .\nWe will be in a much better place by the spring , and then by the summer , we \u2019 ll even be in a better place .\nA year from now , I don \u2019 t know if it will entirely return to normal , but it \u2019 s going to be much better than it is now .\nThe reason I way it may not entirely return to normal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of these vaccines in terms of reducing the amount of virus shed from our nose and mouth .\nSo some of the vaccines in clinical trials prevented death , prevented virus infection in the lungs , but some of the non-human primates and other animals tested still could shed a lot of the virus in their upper airway and mouth .\nSo there still could be a fair bit of virus circulating and that means there could still be some need for masks and social distancing and contact tracing .\nNo question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few months than it is right now .\nGross : With several vaccines likely to come out within a brief time of each other , do you think that one of those vaccines will be like the winner and the others will be the losers ?\nOr should we be grateful that there are so many at the same time because they all have advantages and disadvantages ?\nSome of them might be better for certain populations in certain areas of the world , and others that are for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaccinate the world \u2019 s human population , billions of people .\nAnd even the U.S. population is going to be pretty daunting .\nAnd there \u2019 s no one organization that has the ability to make all that vaccine for world .\nSo we \u2019 re going to need multiple different vaccines and the advantages of having different technologies , even though they all target the spike protein of the virus , is that some may work better over the long run in terms of length of protection or other issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage having all of these different technologies , all these different shots on goal .\nGross : How is your Thanksgiving going to be different from normal years , so called normal years ?\nHotez : Well ordinarily I \u2019 d have all my four adult children together .\nThat would be , that \u2019 s the aspirational goal , but my daughter lives in Los Angeles .\nShe \u2019 s a research scientist at UCLA.I have a son who \u2019 s a musician in Tucson , Arizona .\nThey \u2019 re both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them , but I had to tell them not to come because that would require traveling through dangerous parts of the country in terms of where COVID-19 is really accelerating , especially in New Mexico and El Paso .\n\u2026 Remember this is not forever .\nThis is just for a few more months\u2026 .\nVaccines are coming it \u2019 s just a matter of recognizing you have to get

recently that when a vaccine reaction occurs from a COVID19 vaccine , as we watched happen with the nurse from Tennessee , they fall under the CICP .\nDifferent than the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) , the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) was established under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act , also called the PREP Act .\nIt \u2019 s what consumers will turn to when an injury occurs .\n\u201c A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device , or other item recommended to diagnose , prevent or treat a declared pandemic , epidemic or security threat .\nOn the rare chance you suffered a serious injury , or the death of a loved one , from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure , you may qualify for benefits.\n\u201d [ emphasis mine ] With may being the operative word in that last sentence , I wanted to find more information about this program and process .\nUnder the Frequently Asked Questions , # 6 states that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PREP Act ) authorizes the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) to provide benefits to certain individuals or estates of individuals who sustain a covered serious physical injury as the direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures identified in and administered or used under a PREP Act declaration .\nThe CICP also may provide benefits to certain survivors of individuals who die as a direct result of the administration or use of such covered countermeasures .\nThat may be reassuring for some , but keep in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for compensation associated with the vaccine , doesn \u2019 t exist : Even though a countermeasure injury table for COVID-19 countermeasures has not been established yet , requesters who demonstrate that their injury occurred as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure based on compelling , reliable , valid , medical and scientific evidence , may be eligible for compensation .\n[ emphasis mine ] That said , adverse reactions from vaccines being administered in the United States have been noted .\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse reactions following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that have been reported in clinical trials include injection site pain , fatigue , headache , muscle pain , chills , joint pain , fever , injection site

COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Fact Sheet** for Healthcare Providers reports : adverse reactions reported in a clinical trial following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue , headache , myalgia , arthralgia , chills , nausea/vomiting , axillary swelling/tenderness , fever , swelling at the injection site , and erythema at the injection site .\n( See Full EUA Prescribing

clear when Moderna skipped the animal studies .\nIt goes without saying that the process of getting these vaccines to the market skipped other important steps .\nWith how quickly the vaccines were made available , long-term studies were obviously not conducted .\nDocumenting responses and reactions of the first recipients could create the chance for long-term studies to be established .\nThose who remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination can do so by use the newly created V-safe tool .\nInstructions for how to use it are outlined in the Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet : Provide the v-safe information sheet to vaccine recipients/caregivers and encourage vaccine recipients to participate in v-safe .\nV-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination .\nV-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines .\nV-safe also provides second-dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by CDC if participants report a significant health impact following COVID19 vaccination .\nFor more information , visit : www.cdc.gov/vsafeCDC.gov/vsafe .\nOf

: Yesterday , we told you that Pope Francis , the leader of the Catholic Church , gave his approval of Covid Vaccines .\nHere is a Bishop in Texas , urging caution .\nFrom The Bishop Strickland Hour on Virgin Most Powerful Radio .\nBy Anne Dachel 12 minutes https : //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=uG3MB70OjLo & t=264s Bishop Strickland of the Diocese of Tyler Texas , urges CAUTION getting the COVID-19 vaccine .\nHost Terry Barber : \u2026Bishop Stickland , you \u2019 re in an article from LifeSite News .\nThe headline is , U.S. Bishops Endorse Abortion Tainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Our Neighbor .\nAnd this document entitled Moral Considerations Regarding the New COVID-19 Vaccinations was published just yesterday , December 14th and in this article , you and many other good bishops like Athanasius Schneider and many others , are actually on the other side of the coin in this .\nIn other words , I want to ask you because so many of our listeners are thinking , what should I do with this COVID-19 ?\nIs it moral for me to take this vaccine if it \u2019 s been tainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twenty or thirty years ago .\nThat \u2019 s the case , and in this article they \u2019 re saying that out of charity we should take this vaccine so that someone else won \u2019 t get the COVID-19 .\nWhat \u2019 s your take on all this ?\nBishop Joseph Strickland : I address the question for my flock here in east Texas , and my statement really comes down to this : I can \u2019 t , in good conscience , receive a vaccine myself that is tainted in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used in whatever way for the production of this vaccine .\nI can \u2019 t in good conscience personally receive that .\nI \u2019 m not demanding of others , but I think we need to look at the moral questions .\nWhat I \u2019 ve really encouraged for a lot of other factors that go into these controversial vaccines and this very controversial disease of COVID-19 that truly does kill people , but how we control it and how we deal with it , you can talk to a different expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 ve encouraged people to simply wait , not to rush into vaccines that have been thankfully very quickly produced , but also that \u2019 s somewhat problematic that they were produced so quickly without the usual testing of a vaccine .\nSO my basic instruction says , I personally can \u2019 t in good conscience receive a vaccine that has been tainted , as you say , with the connection to an aborted child , a willfully aborted child .\nThe reality is that other vaccines are in development .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey \u2019 re not been approved yet , but are in development that have no association with aborted children .\nSo I \u2019 ve encourage my flock , and I encourage everyone , but my responsibility is the flock of east Texas here in the diocese of Tyler .\nI \u2019 ve encouraged all the people here , not just the Catholics , but everyone to just wait and evaluate all sorts of factors with these vaccines .\nTo me it \u2019 s a deal breaker when the two that are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have some connection to aborted children .\nAnd if that \u2019 s the case , I \u2019 m not going to receive it .\nBarber : Bishop Strickland , are you aware that the death rate from COVID-19\u2014now notice I said directly from COVID-19\u2014is 0.03 percent , and most of these people who die from COVID die with it , not from it .\nIn other words , they have heart disease , they have other ailments that they have to deal with .\nNinety-two percent of them die with other health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300,000 people that died with COVID , about 10 percent\u2014now this is the CDC\u2014only 10 percent died directly from COVID .\nThat \u2019 s 30,000 people .\nBishop Strickland , \u2026 I read that more people are dying from the flu and pneumonia , and we don \u2019 t stop the economy .\nI believe that it is a virus , and it can be serious , but in my lifetime we \u2019 ve gone through this and we deal with not by using a vaccine that \u2019 s immorally developed or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs.\u2026 Some people go , I \u2019 m going to not allow myself to be connected giving this COVID-19 to anyone else .\nSo I \u2019 m going to wear the mask , stay at home .\nI \u2019 m not going to go to church .\nI \u2019 m not going to do anything because out of charity for my brother and sister out there I \u2019 m just going to not go to work .\nI just live in this bubble because it \u2019 s the right thing to do .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking in all the factors that need to be addressed .\nThat \u2019 s what I encourage people to do , to look at all of it .\n\u2026Each of us needs to consider this and make our own decision .\nI think that people need to very much resist .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of talk about mandates .\n\u2026 I think we need to be very aware that mandating something like this , I think that we need to be very careful about that .\n\u2026 I would encourage people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines because , like you said , there are many factors there .\nThe death rate is not large .\nCertainly any death is bad and life is sacred , but I think we \u2019 ve got to look at all the different factors .\nLook at the fact that these vaccines have been produced very quickly , shortcutting some of the usual testing and all .\nEven beyond the moral issue of using unborn children , unborn neighbors , if we \u2019 re concerned about our neighbor , which we should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unborn neighbors that our society isn \u2019 t concerned about at all\u2026 We need to look at all the sides of the issue and make a well-formed conscience decision .\nBarber : Bishop Strickland , I understand that flying on an airplane\u2026 the airlines are going to say you must have a vaccination shot before you get on certain airlines I would imagine more and more airlines are going to require that .\nI know at the theaters they \u2019 re going to require you to have a vaccine .\nWhat would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can \u2019 t go to the grocery store without having this vaccine ?\nThey \u2019 re not telling you you have to have it , you just can \u2019 t do normal things in life .\nWould it be an overstep to say if they came to your door as the bishop of Tyler , and they said , \u201c Bishop Strickland , as the bishop of Tyler , I want you to implement this.\n\u201d The state is saying , nobody comes into church without being vaccinated .\nWhat would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you .\nBarber : What happens if they pressure you as the bishop saying , \u201c Look\u2026 you need to go along with this because if you don \u2019 t , the church is going to be persecuted ?\n\u201c This has happened before in cultures .\nAre you going to hold the line on that , or what are you going to tell the government if they say you got to close your churches ?\nWhat would you say ?\nBp Strickland : Churches are being persecuted in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality\u2026 That \u2019 s what persecution comes down to .\nIt \u2019 s trying to be forced to do something that goes contrary to your faith .\nWe have to be willing to do what we have to , to live the truth that Jesus Christ has revealed to us .\nAnd if it becomes persecution , then in justice , we need to speak against that and do everything we can to resist any diminishing of the freedom of religion and the freedom of living our faith in every aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , as a bishop , I need to act on what I know and what is true\u2026and act on that\u2026", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

it would be wise to purchase a steam cleaner .\nDuring Ronan 's de-robing phase a few weeks ago , I came to a conclusion that YES , we do need our own steam cleaner .\nDuring that phase , I scrubbed Ronan 's bedroom carpet daily .\nThe cleaner I got his carpet , the dingier other carpeting in the house started to look .\nWhile trying to recall the last time we had them professionally cleaned , I remembered a conversation that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were talking about our kids , the summer ahead , and fun family things to do in town .\nHalfway through the conversation , Ronan walked into the room where we were talking .\nBoy was he was a sight !\nRonan had tried to put on a bathing suit over his shorts , two pair of swim goggles , and swim floaties -- both of them on one arm .\nThe carpet

because it was raining , had us staying home with no plans to go to the pool that day at all .\nThe carpet cleaner guy witnessed sadness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meltdown .\nI do n't know if it broke his heart , but it broke mine .\nSince it was such an emotional moment , I wrote some thoughts down after the guy left and after I 'd successfully redirected Ronan.Cat - 1 , Carpet Cleaner Dude - 0I win.The guy had zero knowledge of vaccine injury .\nOr , maybe he was just clueless .\nMaybe that 's a good thing .\nHe and his wife homeschool their kids , and come to find out , lots of their homeschooling friends do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence helped .\nHe and I each have five children in the same age range .\nIt was interesting to share what I knew .\nIt was insightful for him to see how we lived .\nIt was very interesting watching him watch Ronan .\nThe carpet cleaner dude could easily see the difficulties and the non-verbal struggles .\nHe saw that clearly .\nBut he knew that there was a great amount of beauty in my child , too .\nMaybe this guy did n't have to play the Russian roulette/dodge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMaybe he vaccinated some and they walked away unscathed .\nHe did n't share that with me .\nBut , as I started to tell Ronan 's story he was shocked , you know the cover-your-mouth-reaction shocked .\nHis eyes got wider as I told him about what happened to Ronan -- happy and healthy , then vaccines , then slower to develop , then the discovery of no immunity to the diseases despite the shots , then the seizures , and now special ed , and fighting , and praying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever advocating for all vaccine-injured kiddos everywhere .\nWhile I could 've talked longer , what I was telling him left him speechless .\nMaybe he was just lucky .\nMaybe they were lucky

anymore .\nHe was a Dad , a Dad who listened to every word I said while we sat at my kitchen table .\nHopefully Ronan 's story cemented a thing or two in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parents , and

stories I \u2019 ve been collecting over the past three full years are unstoppable .\nThere is no plateau to be reached where cost and demand level out .\nEverywhere in the English-speaking world , as far as I can see , special education is taking center stage in school budgets talks .\nReports on special ed enrollment are invariably about growth and the need for more teachers to accommodate more special ed students .\nAnd we \u2019 re constantly told that kids with needs go way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education involves students with behavioral issues/emotional problems .\nStories often mention that the disorders these kids have are more complex .\nAnd at the same time all this is going on , our children are increasingly plagued with chronic health problems never before seen at today \u2019 s rates .\nSo how will we pay for all of this ?\nWill we have to take from the general ed money to pay for special ed ?\nActually I am seeing this being talked about in news reports .\nThere \u2019 s no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money has to come for somewhere since it \u2019 s a federal law that special needs kids have a right to a free and appropriate education , and the feds haven \u2019 t increased funding .\nThis means state and local governments have to come up with the cash .\nSo how much longer will this go on ?\nAre we approaching a point where someone will sound an alarm and demand we look into the state of children \u2019 s physical , mental , emotional health ?\nI \u2019 d like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism grow from a novel , unheard of condition over the past twenty years to a normal and acceptable part of childhood .\nThe same thing seems to be happening with all kids with special ed needs .\nLet me start with a really strange story from the Pocohantas ( WV ) Times entitled , School system increasing medical staff for student safety .\nStaff reporter Suzanne Stewart made it clear that students are coming to school with really serious health issues/learning problems all the while she \u2019 s completely disinterested in why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c \u2026 the medical issues of students today have grown to the point that a medical professional is needed full-time.\n\u201d To meet the needs of the students , superintendent of schools Terrence Beam said the Pocahontas County Board of Education is seeking two LPNs to assist school nurse Jenny Friel .\n\u2018 Our kids are coming to us with all kinds of emotional and physical issues that \u2013 up to this point \u2013 we have been unable to provide the assistance that was necessary\u2026 .\n\u2018 The actual physical condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years ago .\nWe have more diabetic students .\nWe have more kids with major allergies .\nWe have kids with seizure disorders.\n\u2019 \u2026 Schools now are in charge providing medical care as well as classroom learning , and while we \u2019 re told there are school-based clinics in every school , this is not enough .\n\u201c In addition to physical medical concerns , there is also an increase in social and emotional issues , which Beam hopes to also address soon.\n\u201d Beam : \u2018 The next step we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ a social worker for our schools .\n\u2026We \u2019 re going to expand our counseling services.\n\u2019 At the end , the superintendent conceded that he has no choice .\nWe have to adjust to the students of the 21st century .\n\u2018 Sometimes we focus a lot on the academics and the athletics in our school systems , but we really need to look at the physical and the mental condition of our kids , because it is difficult.\n\u2019 So if the superintendent isn \u2019 t looking for answers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for an explanation for what \u2019 s happening , nothing will improve .\nExpect the downward spiral to continue .\nAll the things happening in Pocahontas County schools should be seen as an unprecedented crisis .\nMore kids with diabetes , seizures , and \u2018 major allergies \u2019 should be scaring everyone .\nPocahontas County is not alone in this nightmare .\nHere are a few examples to show just how widespread this is .\n$ 5.6M in county funding will be used to hire 25 new social workers for the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking to hire 30 additional mental-health professionals , including counselors and psychologists\u2026 .\n\u201c Staffing deficits at CMS call for recruiting 500 more social workers , as well as 150 counselors and 115 psychologists , according to an analysis provided to the Mecklenburg County commissioners ahead of their annual board retreat next week .\n\u2026 \u201c In recent years , the number of students screened for suicide risk at CMS has soared.\n\u201d Alabama Department of Education is asking for $ 7.7M in additional funding to address student mental health .\n\u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across our district , we 're seeing an increase of mental health issues at an earlier age for students.\n\u2019 \u201c The money would also provide more full-time therapists to schools .\n\u2026 \u201d Danville , Pennsylvania school district is shortening the school day and reducing class requirements to help improve students mental health .\nA bill in the state legislature to authorize all school nurses to stock Albuterol inhalers for students with asthma .\nThe government of Alberta , as of Jan 1st , \u201c has required all K-12 schools in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto-injector ( EpiPen ) on-site at all times \u201d in case of a severe allergic reaction .\n\u201c Barking and Dagenham has experienced rapidly increasing numbers of youngsters needing support for special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ) , councillors heard .\n\u201c A forecast total of 113 primary and 353 secondary SEND pupils is anticipated over the next four years , the majority with autism\u2026.\n\u201d \u201c [ Superintendent ] Iassogna had told the board the schools were running a deficit projected at up to $ 2 million and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on overtime and substitute teacher costs\u2026 .\n\u201c The biggest factor , though , is special education and transportation for students in special education programs , he said .\n\u201c \u2018 In October 2019 , we identified $ 1.4 million in special education and transportation costs , \u2019 O \u2019 Keefe said .\n\u2018 That number has only grown.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c With more students having more

that the population keeps growing without any additional funding.\n\u2019 \u201c Between the 2007 to 20017 school years , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than doubled\u2026 \u201c \u2018 There are just too

Allen .\n\u2018 I don \u2019 t know all the reasons and I guess it doesn \u2019 t matter for this argument .\nWe have the issue now let \u2019 s try to help these kids.\n\u2019 \u201d \u2026 \u201c Cedar Rapids elementary school students were held in seclusion rooms or physically restrained 237 times in the first month of this school year \u2014 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four times as much as in the first month of the 2015-2016 school year\u2026 .\n\u201c School seclusion has been a lightning rod in recent years as more parents learn about 6-by-6 foot rooms with padded walls used to contain overwrought students in schools across Iowa\u2026 .\n\u201c \u2026most elementary students were put into seclusion for violent behavior that included kicking , biting , hitting and throwing items that could harm others\u2026 .\n\u201c Teacher and staff injuries that involved students rose 88 percent , from 226 to 425 , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Schools , \u2026 \u201d \u201c With concern growing that an increasing use of the booths for disruptive students could have serious effects on young people 's mental health , we asked if their use should be stopped.\n\u201d \u201c As schools deal with an increasing number of children with disabilities like autism , demand for disabilities awareness and sensitivity programs has increased , meaning Portland-based organization The Cromwell Center currently has a waiting list of 25 schools\u2026 .\n\u201c She estimates that between 10 and 12 percent of the school \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that while she has not noticed more autism diagnoses in recent years , she said the number of students who are in special education or require an individualized education plan has increased over the last few years.\n\u201d \u201c Collected data also showed students with disabilities were secluded more frequently than those without disabilities .\nDuring the 2013-2014 school year , students with disabilities were subjected to seclusion rates \u2018 that far exceeded those of other students , \u2019 according to an OCR report published in 2016\u2026.\n\u201d \u201c A special school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitions , during a five-week consultation .\n\u201c Baytree School , in Weston , is desperately in need of more space to cope with the growing demand for children with special educational needs.\n\u201d \u201c Families of autistic children are facing waits of up to three years for a formal diagnosis , a charity has warned .\n\u201c Around half ( 46 per cent ) of families waited 18 months or longer for a formal diagnosis for their autistic child , according to a survey of nearly 4,000 parents by Ambitious about Autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly three in four ( 70 per cent ) parents said they were still not offered adequate support for their child \u2013 such as therapies that help with speech and language.\n\u201d \u201c Over the past decade , greater numbers of Arkansas children have been diagnosed with disabilities that require them to receive education .\n\u201c Consequently , Arkansas public schools are spending greater amounts of money on special education .\n\u201c Last year , there were almost 64,000 students with a diagnosed disability in Arkansas public schools .\nThat is 13.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrollment\u2026 .\n\u201c The number of students diagnosed with autism has gone up 55 % since 2013 .\nThe increase is attributable to an increased awareness among educators and others of the characteristics of autism .\n\u201c The growth in children diagnosed with dyslexia has followed a similar trend .\nIn 2014 , for example , 957 students received therapy for dyslexia .\nIn 2014 , only 89 school districts and one charter school reported results from screening for dyslexia.\n\u201d \u201c A special needs school has welcomed plans to increase its capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c New Rush Hall school , in Fencepiece Road , Fairlop , will be expanded from 64 places to 80 after Redbridge Council gave plans the green light on Tuesday , January 7 .\n\u201c The school \u2013 rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2016 \u2013 is a specialist school for children and young people experiencing significant social , emotional , behavioural and/or mental health difficulties .\n\u201c Executive headteacher , Sam Walters , welcomed the news , saying the demand for places had greatly risen in recent years .\n\u201c He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the number of young people needing EHC plans , particularly for social and mental health needs , has naturally meant that there are not enough appropriate school place to meet the populaces needs.\n\u2019 \u2026 \u201c Since 2014 , the number of Redbridge resident pupils with an EHC plan has risen approximately 35 per cent .\n\u201c Council officials estimate the borough \u2019 s special educational needs and disability ( SEND ) pupil population will grow by 16.5 per cent ( 153 school places ) for primary education and 33.7 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2025.\n\u201d \u201c Tuition for out-of-district placement of some students often runs well into six figures \u201c The high cost of special education in New Jersey is getting renewed attention , as Senate President Steve Sweeney presses the state to do more to help districts pay for students with severe disabilities\u2026 .\n\u201c Long an advocate for special education as a parent of a child with special needs , Sweeney said he wants to ease the tension that arises with the high costs of serving these students , and said the state can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising costs of special education \u2014 and specifically those of specialized outside schools where tuition costs can reach six figures \u2014 has been a contentious issue for years , if not decades\u2026.\n\u201d \u201c \u2018 So this whole thing here is the sensory hallway , and we added it as a way for kids to calm down themselves , \u2019 said Norah Barney , Lincoln Primary School principal .\nShe said the school \u2019 s occupational therapist , Addie Hall , created the pathway just in time for the 2019-2020 school year\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor skills and provides sensory input , the sensory hallway is part of a larger movement to get Lincoln students to learn how to \u2018 self-regulate.\n\u2019 \u201c \u2018 What \u2019 s self-regulate ?\nSo think of it like : When you get upset , are you able to calm yourself without assistance ?\n\u2019 explained Barney.\n\u201d \u201c The plan is part of Norfolk County Council \u2019 s \u00a3120 million [ $ 160M US ] transformation of special educational needs .\n\u201c The programme seeks to create 500 extra school places by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expanding existing SRBs or building new ones.\n\u201d \u201c With one in eight children suffering from some form of

Ronan back in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thorough and incredibly kind .\nBefore the new doc would get a chance to share his thoughts with me , he asked that I recap some of Ronan \u2019 s medical history and what had brought us to the hospital last month .\nI shared as much as I thought relevant , and then I listened to him share what he knew .\nHe knew a lot !\nIt was clear that he took time to read through much of Ronan \u2019 s medical file .\nHe was aware of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knowledgeable of the type of care Ronan receives already and wanted to continue what was working without interruption .\nI got a good feeling this new doctor , so I eagerly listened to the treatment he wanted to propose .\nSince my husband couldn \u2019 t join us that day , I took notes while the doctor spoke .\nI stopped writing when the doctor shared that he wanted to bring in more specialist .\nReminding myself that adding specialists isn \u2019 t always a bad thing , I locked eyes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me more .\nHe filled me in on who would also join the team and then gave me time to ask as many questions as I could think of .\nA young resident , who had joined us in the exam room ,

is not being addressed by our governments or officials .\nHowever much they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubric `` the benefits greatly outweigh the risks '' or even the grandiose `` vaccines are safe '' a lot
