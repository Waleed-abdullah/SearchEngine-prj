Unprecedented Challenge to NIST in New Filing", "content": "Family members of those who died on September 11 , 2001 , joined building experts earlier today in submitting a \u201c request for correction \u201d to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) regarding its 2008 report on the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 .\nThe request , which comprises more than 100 pages and five exhibits , represents an unprecedented challenge to NIST \u2019 s report on WTC 7 .\nWith the ultimate aim of forcing NIST to reverse its conclusion that fires caused the building \u2019 s destruction , the request covers eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate the agency \u2019 s information quality standards .\nOnly by revising its \u201c probable collapse sequence \u201d can NIST correct these violations , the request contends .\nStarting today , under the procedure governing requests submitted to NIST , the agency has four months to respond .\nIf NIST elects not to take corrective action , it must provide a \u201c point-by-point response to any relevant data quality arguments contained in the request.\n\u201d The request notes that if NIST does not provide a point-by-point response , NIST will have denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , \u201d which would set the stage for legal action to force compliance .\nThe request relies substantially on a report issued last month by researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ( UAF ) , who concluded definitively that the destruction of the 47-story WTC 7 was not caused by fires .\nTheir extensive four-year computer modeling effort was followed by a robust peer review process , which included dozens of comments from the public as well as review by two external , independent experts .\nThe study was funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AE911Truth ) , a nonprofit representing more than 3,000 architects and engineers who have signed the organization \u2019 s petition calling for new investigation into the destruction of the three World Trade Center towers on 9/11 .\nAE911Truth is now spearheading the request for correction based on the findings of the study .\nOther signers of the request include 88 architects and structural engineers and ten family members of 9/11 victims .\n\u201c We are proud to have supported the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Professor Leroy Hulsey in conducting a genuinely scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s collapse , \u201d said Richard Gage , founder of AE911Truth .\n\u201c Now that the study is complete , the request for correction will force NIST to reverse its outlandish conclusion that fires were the cause of the collapse.\n\u201d For many of the family members , the request is their latest effort in a long journey to uncover the truth about the murder of their loved one .\nFor others , it is their first time taking action .\n\u201c I was sixteen years old when my father was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year , I \u2019 ve come to learn much more about his murder , \u201d said Kacee Papa , one of the ten family members to sign the request .\n\u201c I would like to see the truth come out so that families can be aware , obtain justice , and above all ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.\n\u201d AE911Truth is inviting more 9/11 family members , architects , structural engineers , and organizations representing building professionals to join the request for correction .\nPlease email RFC @ AE911Truth.org @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories and would like to join the request .\nPlease see the original post to download the exhibits to the RFC .",

claims of secrecy", "content": "U.S. Attorney General William Barr and acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell broadly invoked the state secrets privilege this week to block 9/11 survivors and family members from obtaining crucial evidence to support their multi-billion dollar damages lawsuit against Saudi Arabia .\nIn sworn public declarations filed in federal court in New York , the nation \u2019 s top law enforcement official and the overseer of the U.S. intelligence community said their formal assertions of the state secrets privilege were necessary to \u201c protect the national security interests of the United States.\n\u201d \u201c This assertion of privilege is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information concerning foreign government information ; intelligence activities , sources and methods ; and information concerning foreign relations and foreign activities of the United States , including confidential sources , \u201d wrote Grenell , who was appointed by President Trump on Feb. 20 .\n\u201c This information must be protected because its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage , and in many cases exceptionally grave damage , to the national security of the United States.\n\u201d Barr said his assertion of the state secret privilege \u201c encompasses four categories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , including information which would indicate that a particular individual or entity is or was the subject of a national security investigation .\n\u2022 Reasons for investigation and results , including information which would reveal the reasons a person or entity is or was the subject of a national security investigation and information obtained as a result of that investigation .\n\u2022 Sources and methods , including information that could tend to reveal FBI sources , methods or techniques or classified policies and procedures .\n\u2022 Foreign government information and information sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information received from a foreign government .\nSean Carter , a co-chair of the 9/11 plaintiff \u2019 s executive committee , called Barr \u2019 s assertions \u201c extraordinary and unprecedented.\n\u201d \u201c This has pretty staggering implications going forward , \u201d Carter said .\n\u201c Very broadly , it takes the view that the executive branch can declare that information falls into certain general categories , like investigative findings , and can declare that by virtue of status in those categories it can be treated as a state secret .\nIf this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside 9/11 , it is a glide path for the government to withhold almost anything.\n\u201d Along with the two public declarations , the government filed a number of \u201c classified submissions lodged for the Court \u2019 s ex parte , in camera review.\n\u201d Translation : even lawyers for the 9/11 plaintiffs can not see them .\nThose classified , nonpublic documents which ostensibly seek to justify the extreme secrecy are identified as a second declaration with attachments by Grenell , a declaration by the \u201c Central Intelligence Agency , \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s subordinates , Jill Sanborn and Brian Gilhooly , officials in the FBI \u2019 s Counterterrorism Division , and New York City Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Normand .\nThe 9/11 families are seeking FBI records regarding Saudi Arabia \u2019 s alleged support to the al Qaeda terrorists who used passenger jets to attack New York \u2019 s World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11 , 2001 .\nThree years ago , the court allowed the 9/11 plaintiffs to try to discover new information about Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .\nThumairy and Bayoumi provided assistance to Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar , who were part of the hijacking team that plowed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon .\nA heavily censored October 2012 FBI summary report obtained by Florida Bulldog in 2016 during Freedom of Information Act litigation revealed that as of that date \u2013 eight years after the 9/11 Commission had ended \u2013 FBI agents and prosecutors in New York were actively targeting an apparent support network in the U.S. for Hazmi and Mihdhar .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawyers for the 9/11 families tried unsuccessfully later to obtain an unredacted copy of that report .\nPresident Trump , after meeting with family members at the White House last Sept. 11 , ordered the release of one name in the report \u2013 the person identified as having \u201c tasked \u201d Thumairy and Bayoumi with aiding Hazmi and Mihdhar .\nThe name has not been made public .\nA few days later , Attorney General Barr blocked the release of any additional \u201c classified national security information \u201d in the 2012 report when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in the case .\nBoth Barr and DNI Grenell , who also serves as the U.S. ambassador to Germany , noted that their assertions of privilege were not made \u201c to conceal a violation of law , or administrative error ; to prevent embarrassment to a person , organization , or agency of the Government ; to restrain competition ; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interests of national security.\n\u201d Said Grenell , \u201c I make these assertions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both authorized and unauthorized \u2013 of information regarding the events surrounding and investigations of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .\nHowever

sought CIA help to investigate Sarasota Saudis who fled U.S. before 9/11", "content": "The FBI agent who led the post 9/11 investigation of Saudis who moved out of their Sarasota-area home under suspicious circumstances two weeks before the 2001 al Qaeda attacks urged the FBI to seek information from the CIA about whether they assisted the terrorist hijackers .\nThat \u2019 s among the final disclosures the FBI made recently to conclude a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit brought by Florida Bulldog in 2012 seeking records of a bureau investigation that was once so secret its existence was withheld from both Congress and the 9/11 Commission .\nNews that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ratchet it up by contacting the CIA for further information about the Saudis with ties to the Royal Family was redacted from an explosive April 16 , 2002 FBI report when it was released to Florida Bulldog in 2013 \u2013 six months after the FOIA lawsuit was filed by Miami First Amendment attorney Thomas Julin .\nMost significantly , the heavily censored report written by FBI Agent Gregory Sheffield said agents had found \u201c many connections \u201d between the Sarasota Saudis and the hijackers who trained at a nearby airport .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight student at Huffman Aviation , \u201d where two of the 9/11 hijack pilots trained .\n\u201c For these reasons , the FBI is interested in determining if the Central Intelligence Agency has any investigative interest or reason to investigate , \u201d the newly released information says .\n\u201c Any information which the CIA could provide to the FBI would be useful in the FBI investigation.\n\u201d The FBI was investigating Abdulazziz al-Hijji ; his wife , Anoud , and her father , Esam Ghazzawi , a wealthy Saudi businessman with ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saud and international and American political leaders .\nThe case began after neighbors alerted authorities , and agents of the Southwest Florida Domestic Security Task force determined the al-Hijjis \u201c left their residence quickly and suddenly \u201d about two weeks before the attacks on New York and Washington , according to an April 3 , 2002 FBI report .\nThe al-Hijjis and Ghazzawi returned to Saudi Arabia .\nFlorida Bulldog , working with Irish author Anthony Summers , first reported the existence of the FBI \u2019 s Sarasota investigation in 2011 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that the al-Hijjis \u2019 upscale home in the gated community Prestancia had been visited by vehicles used by the hijackers and that phone calls were linked between the residence and 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta , who was at the controls when American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center .\nFlorida Bulldog , working with Irish author Anthony Summers , first reported the existence of the FBI \u2019 s Sarasota investigation in 2011 .\nThe story included news that agents had learned that the al-Hijjis \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been visited by vehicles used by the hijackers and that phone calls were linked between the residence and 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta , who was at the controls when American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center .\nFormer Florida Gov .\nand U.S. Sen. Bob Graham , who co-chaired Congress \u2019 Joint Inquiry into 9/11 , was disturbed the FBI had not informed his committee about the Sarasota investigation and said it suggested the FBI had deliberately concealed the investigation because it might point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c opens the door to a new chapter of investigation as to the depth of the Saudi role in 9/11.\n\u201d Early FBI statements confirmed the existence of the investigation , but sought to dismiss its significance , saying it was \u201c determined not to be related to any threat nor connected to the 9/11 plot.\n\u201d No further explanation was provided .\nThe release of the \u201c many connections \u201d report two years later ran counter to the FBI \u2019 s public position .\nNational security was the original reason cited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mention of the CIA a secret .\nFort Lauderdale Senior U.S. District Judge William J. Zloch , however , overruled that decision last August and ordered the FBI to disclose the information .\n\u201c This material is highly relevant to plaintiff \u2019 s request , \u201d Zloch wrote in his 95-page order .\nThe information remained secret for months while the FBI considered an appeal it finally chose not to pursue .\nWhen it finally released the redacted information , the FBI offered no explanation as to why it believed its release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld the FBI \u2019 s secrecy concerns following a five-year , in-camera review of more than 80,000 classified pages of 9/11 records produced by the FBI \u2019 s Tampa Field Office .\nIn his order , he \u201c assured \u201d Florida Bulldog that he \u2019 d seen no records pertaining to the FBI \u2019 s Sarasota investigation .\nThat statement immediately raised questions about what happened to numerous interview reports , financial documents , telephone and Prestancia gatehouse security records that knowledgeable sources have said agents collected during the two-year probe .\nWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge ?\nThe most likely answer : they are hidden behind a little known secrecy wall \u2013 an \u201c exclusion \u201d to the Freedom of Information Act \u2013 that allows the FBI to say certain sensitive records don \u2019 t exist when in fact they do .\nWhile Judge Zloch was still reading the 80,000 pages , the secretive 9/11 Review Commission released unclassified portions of its final report , including a look at new evidence that had emerged in recent years .\nThe commission , whose three members were chosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upheld the FBI \u2019 s contention that its Sarasota investigation found nothing suspicious .\nThe FBI told commissioners the April 2002 \u201c many connection \u201d report was \u201c poorly written and wholly unsubstantiated \u2019 \u2019 and that the agent who wrote them \u201c was unable to provide any basis for the contents of the document or explain why he wrote it as he did , \u201d according to the report .\nThe commission , also known as the Meese Commission because its senior member was Reagan-era Attorney General Ed Meese , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from FBI Agent Sheffield .\nThe commission also did not address Sen. Graham \u2019 s assertion that the FBI had hidden its Sarasota probe from Congress or examine FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement records obtained by the Bulldog detailing 2004 statements by informant Wissam Taysir Hammoud that al-Hijji had introduced him to senior al Qaeda leader Adnan El-Shukrijumah and that al-Hijji had told him Osama bin Laden was his hero .\nIn an attempt to understand the Meese Commission \u2019 s conclusions and to obtain transcripts of its proceedings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably an Oct. 5 , 2012 FBI report mentioned in a footnote \u2013 Florida Bulldog sent another FOIA request to the FBI in April 2015 .\nWhen the FBI would not produce any records , a second lawsuit was filed in July 2016 .\nAs the case moved toward an anticipated trial 2017 trial , the FBI produced hundreds of pages of heavily redacted Meese Commission records .\nIncluded were records about how much the FBI \u2019 s personal service contracts with Meese and the other commissioners and documents in which the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Prestancia gatehouse records that those who disclosed the existence of the investigation said were collected and showed that Atta and other hijackers had visited the al-Hijji residence .\nThe released records also included an Oct. 5 , 2012 FBI report titled \u201c Updates and Initiatives ( as of 5 October 2012 ) .\n\u201d The report contained no information about Sarasota , yet clearly showed that despite FBI assertions that the 9/11 investigation had concluded years before , it was still active and ongoing in 2012 .\nUncensored parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained \u201c evidence \u201d that two Saudis \u2013 Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi \u2014 known to have assisted 9/11 hijackers during their time in southern California were \u201c tasked \u201d to do so by a mysterious third person whose name had been censored .\nThat new information was of immediate interest to attorneys representing 9/11 victims suing Saudi Arabia in federal court in New York .\nIn July 2017 , Miami federal Judge Cecilia Altonaga avoided a trial in Florida Bulldog \u2019 s FOIA case seeking to open up redacted Meese Commission records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment .\nThe ruling required the FBI to lift some redactions , including the names of agents working the matter , but essentially shut the case down .\nBoth Florida Bulldog and the FBI appealed .\nBut in New York , where the 9/11 victims \u2019 lawsuit , long stymied by sovereign immunity that was lifted in 2016 when Congress overwhelmingly passed \u2013 over President Obama \u2019 s veto \u2013 a law allowing their claims against Saudi Arabia to proceed in U.S. courts , new and consolidated complaints were filed in March 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report as a key part of its argument , attaching it as evidence that \u201c Saudi government employees and agents who in the FBI \u2019 s own words , provided \u2018 substantial assistance \u2019 to the 9/11 hijackers.\n\u2019 \u201d The Kingdom sought to dismiss the complaint , but in 2018 a New York federal judge denied its motion while limiting discovery in the case to \u201c the alleged tortious acts \u201d in California of Thumairy and Bayoumi .\nThe ruling put the October 2012 report , and the information it contained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plaintiffs \u2019 lawyers subpoenaed the government to produce an unredacted version of the 2012 report .\nAfter the Justice Department refused , the plaintiffs asked the court to compel its release .\nLast September , after meeting with 9/11 survivors and family members , President Trump instructed Attorney General William Barr to declassify the name of the third person who had \u201c tasked \u201d Thumairy and Bayoumi with helping the hijackers .\nThe name was given to the 9/11 attorneys with instructions that they could not to share it with anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the name of Musaed al-Jarrah became public when the FBI inadvertently released it in court papers .\nJarrah is a former Saudi Foreign Ministry official who worked at the Saudi embassy in Washington in 1999-2000.s The rest of the 2012 FBI report remains classified because Barr invoked the \u201c state secrets privilege \u201d to hide it , telling the court that disclosure \u201c would risk significant harm to national security.\n\u201d In April , using legal arguments that were themselves secret , Barr invoked \u201c state secrets \u201d again more broadly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining other crucial evidence in support their multi-billion dollar lawsuit that seeks to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the four coordinated al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 that employed hijacked passenger jets to kill 2,977 people and injure 25,000 others .\nToday , the 2012 report remains a central focus of the New York case as plaintiffs \u2019 attorneys push back on the government \u2019 s secrecy decisions .\nOn Thursday , the attorneys are expected to file a reply opposing Barr \u2019 s state secrets claims .\nThe public won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either because the court has approved a sweeping FBI \u201c protective order \u201d that is shielding from public view virtually everything about the matter .\nMeanwhile , a split federal appeals court in Atlanta last September came down largely on the side of the FBI , overturning Judge Altonaga in a ruling that held the privacy of suspects , witnesses and FBI agents involved in the 9/11 investigation outweighs the public interest in knowing their names .\nThe court also deferred to the FBI \u2019 s decisions to withhold other information , declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 , The New York Times Magazine published a lengthy story , \u201c The Saudi Connection : Inside the 9/11 Case.\n\u201d The story was built around disclosures in the 2012 FBI report and interviews with former agents that explained how a team of investigators in a divided FBI had kept working the 9/11 case as a \u201c subfile \u201d under the code name \u201c Operation Encore.\n\u201d The subfile probe was essentially shut down in 2016 .\n\u201c The Encore investigation exposed a bitter rift within the bureau over the Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A senior FBI analyst prepared a \u201c forceful summary \u201d of Encore \u2019 s findings , \u201c laying out in 16 pages everything the team found about suspected Saudi complicity in the plot , \u201d the Times reported .\n\u201c He then uploaded the secret document into the FBI \u2019 s electronic record , ensuring that it could not be erased.\n\u201d Those 16 pages remain hidden today \u2013 covered up by Attorney General Barr \u2019 s assertion that it and numerous other FBI records about 9/11 are state secrets of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens .\n\u2022 U.S. judge asked to okay
